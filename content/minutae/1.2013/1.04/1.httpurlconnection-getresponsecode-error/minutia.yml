    There is a small issue that causes HTTPUrlConnection to hang when trying to retrieve the response code via `getResponseCode()` after which an Exception is thrown.

    In my case I was authenticating against an oAuth Server and expecting a 401 error. As per [RFC2617](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt):

    > The 401 (Unauthorized) response message is used by an origin server to challenge the authorization of a user agent. This response **MUST** include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing at least one challenge applicable to the requested resource.

    Which simply means the response **must** include the `WWW-Authenticate` header set without which the method throws `java.io.IOException: No authentication challenges found`.

    <pre class="brush: plain">
    header('WWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm="users"');
    header('HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized');
    </pre>

    So far, this is normal and expected.

    On Android, the lack of "" wrapping on realm caused the app to hang, therefore crashing the app ... so use this `realm="..."` instead of `realm=...` if you own the server-side API.

    Looking at the [spec] they seem to imply that the values should be in quotes ... but its not 100% clear.
