    are wary of other alternatives as well as dismissive of their ability to

    the link between action and result_."

    that these disillusioning events have led to a different epistemological
    framework. "We are deeply resistant to idealism. Rather, the Cynic Kids have
    embraced the policy revolution; _they require hypothesis to be tested,
    substantiated, and then results replicated before_ they commit to any course of
    action."

    > Maybe this empirical mind-set is a sign of maturity, but Buhler
    acknowledges that the "yearning for definitive 'evidence' ... can retard action
