    > Being in your twenties ...

    > It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that
    > there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not
    > like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or
    > two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.

    > You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends
    > that you thought you were so close to you aren't exactly the greatest
    > people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some
    > of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are
    > realizing that too, and they aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere,
    > but that they are just as confused as you.

    > You look at your job ... and it is not even close to what you thought you
    > would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you
    > are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you. Your
    > opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find
    > yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you
    > have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to
    > your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are
    > insecure and then the next, secure.

    > You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and
    > scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling
    > on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting
    > further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you
    > are or move forward.

    > You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such
    > damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone
    > decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love
    > someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you're doing
    > this because you know that you aren't a bad person. You want to settle
    > down for good because now all of a sudden that becomes top priority.
    > Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You begin
    > to think a companion for life is better than a hundred in the shack and
    > for once you would not mind standing tall for that special someone which
    > otherwise you had never thought of until now.

    > You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk
    > with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a
    > decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for
    > yourself ... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd
    > just like to be a contender!

    > What you may not realize is that every one reading this
    > relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of
    > times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing
    > out.

    1. I can't, for the life of me, remember where I got this so don't sue me.
    2. Gimme a shout if you know the origin so I can give credit where it's due.
