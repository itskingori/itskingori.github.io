    > When it comes to our careers and our experience at work, we’ve become
    > selfish—but in a good way. Getting paid is no longer enough; we expect to
    > actually learn on the job. We want our skills to be fully utilized and are
    > left unsatisfied by “easy jobs.” We want more responsibility when we’re
    > ready, rather than waiting until we’ve “put in our time.” We expect to do
    > more of what we love, automating the more laborious and monotonous parts
    > of our work.

    > Chalk it up to new technology, social media, or the once out-of-reach
    > business tools now at your fingertips. The fact is, we’re empowered to
    > work on our own terms and do more with less. As a result, we expect more
    > from those that employ us and we expect more from ourselves. When we get
    > the resources and opportunities we deserve, we create the future.

    > Here’s a name for us: _**Free Radicals**_.

    > Free Radicals want to take their careers into their own hands and put the
    > world to work for them. Free Radicals are resilient, self-reliant, and
    > extremely potent. You’ll find them working solo, in small teams, or within
    > large companies. As the world changes, Free Radicals have re-imagined
    > “work” as we know it. No doubt, we have lofty expectations:

    > **We do work that is, first and foremost, intrinsically rewarding**  
    > But, we don’t create solely for ourselves, we want to make a real and
    > lasting impact in the world around us.

    > **We thrive on flexibility and are most productive when we feel fully
    > engaged**  
    > We demand freedom, whether we work within companies or on our own, to run
    > experiments, participate in multiple projects at once, and move our ideas
    > forward.

    > **We make stuff often, and therefore, we fail often**  
    > Ultimately, we strive for little failures that help us course-correct
    > along the way, and we view every failure as a learning opportunity, part
    > of our experiential education.

    > **We have little tolerance for the friction of bureaucracy, old-boy
    > networks, and antiquated business practices**  
    > As often as possible, we question “standard operating procedure” and
    > assert ourselves. But even when we can’t, we don’t surrender to the
    > friction of the status quo. Instead, we find clever ways (and hacks)
    > around it.

    > **We expect to be fully utilized and constantly optimized, regardless of
    > whether we’re working in a startup or a large organization**  
    > When our contributions and learning plateau, we leave. But when we’re
    > leveraging a large company’s resources to make an impact in something we
    > care about, we are thrilled! We want to always be doing our best work and
    > making the greatest impact we can.

    > **We consider “open source” technology, API’s, and the vast collective
    > knowledge of the Internet to be our personal arsenal**  
    > Wikipedia, Quora, and open communities for designers, developers, and
    > thinkers were built by us and for us. Whenever possible, we leverage
    > collective knowledge to help us make better decisions for ourselves and
    > our clients. We also contribute to these open resources with a “pay it
    > forward” mentality.

    > **We believe that “networking” is sharing**  
    > People listen to (and follow) us because of our discernment and curatorial
    > instinct. As we share our creations as well as what fascinates us, we
    > authentically build a community of supporters that give us feedback,
    > encouragement, and lead us to new opportunities. For this reason and more,
    > we often (though, not always) opt for transparency over privacy.

    > **We believe in meritocracy and the power of online networks and peer
    > communities to advance our ability to do what we love, and do well by
    > doing it**  
    > We view competition as a positive motivator rather than a threat, because
    > we want the best idea – and the best execution – to triumph.

    > **We make a great living doing what we love. We consider ourselves as both
    > artisans and businesses**  
    > In many cases, we are our own accounting department, Madison Avenue
    > marketing agency, business development manager, negotiator, and
    > salesperson. We spend the necessary energy to invest in ourselves as
    > businesses – leveraging the best tools and knowledge (most of which are
    > free and online) to run ourselves as a modern-day enterprise.
