    > Lee put out a booklet called Helpful Hints and Advice to Employees, which
    > opened by declaring a "sole and simple" purpose that was far from simple.
    > It was "to better the financial and moral standing of each employee and
    > those of his household; to instill men with courage and a desire for
    > health, happiness, and prosperity. To give father and mother sufficient
    > for present and future; to provide for families in sickness, in health and
    > in old age and to take away fear and worry. To make a well rounded life
    > and not a mere struggle for existence to men and their families, and to
    > implant in the heart of every individual the wholesome desire to Help the
    > Other Fellow, whenever he comes across your path, to the extent of your
    > ability."
