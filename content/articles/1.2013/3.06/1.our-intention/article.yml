    If everyone, is busy making everything,<br>
    how can anyone perfect anything?<br>
    <br>
    We start to confuse convenience with joy,<br>
    abundance with choice.<br>
    Designing something requires focus.<br>
    The first thing we ask is,<br>
    what do we want people to feel?<br>
    Delight. Surprise. Love. Connection.<br>
    Then we begin to craft around our intention.<br>
    It takes time ...<br>
    There are a thousand no-s for every yes.<br>
    We simplify.<br>
    We perfect.<br>
    We start over, until everything we touch,<br>
    enhances each life it touches.<br>
    <br>
    Only then do we sign our work.<br>
