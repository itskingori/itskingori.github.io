    ###Purpose###

    > It is common to suggest that the purpose of the book is to answer the age -
    > old question, _"Why does God allow the righteous to suffer?"_  That is
    > certainly the question Job raises, but it is worthy to note that he
    > himself never receives a direct answer. Nor is one given by the author,
    > other than to answer Satan's challenge, _"Does Job fear God for nothing?"_.
    > We are privileged to know of the challenge of Satan, and that God allows
    > Job to suffer in answer to that challenge, but Job is never told of this.
    > Therefore, I suggest that the purpose of the book is:

    > **To answer the question, "How should the righteous suffer?"**

    > While Job's questions and complaints often come close to charging God with
    > wrong, he never crosses the line and humbly submits to God when told that
    > the answers to his questions are beyond his ability to understand.  Thus
    > the book shows us how the righteous should bear up under suffering (_"You
    > have heard of the perseverance of Job"_ - Jm 5:11)

    ###Some Lessons###

    > * **The book defends the absolute glory and perfection of God** - It sets
    > forth the theme echoed in Ps 18:3 (_"I will call upon the Lord, who is
    > worthy to be praised"_).  God is deserving of our praise simply on the
    > basis of who He is, apart from the blessings He bestows.  Satan denied
    > this (1:9-11), but Job proved him wrong (1:20-22; 2:10).

    > * **The question of suffering is addressed** - Why do we suffer? Who or what
    > causes it?  Why doesn't God do something?  Not all questions are answered,
    > but some important points are made:

    >    * **Man is unable to subject the painful experiences of human existence to a
    >    meaningful analysis** - God's workings are beyond man's ability to fathom.
    >    Man simply cannot tie all the "loose ends" of the Lord's purposes
    >    together.  We must learn to trust in God, no matter the circumstances.

    >    * **Suffering is not always the result of personal sin** - The erroneous
    >    conclusion drawn by Job's friends is that suffering is always a
    >    consequence of sin.  Job proves this is not the case.

    >    * **Suffering may be allowed as a compliment to one's spirituality** - God
    >    allowed Job to suffer to prove to Satan what kind of man he really was.
    >    What confidence God had in Job!

    > * **The book paints a beautiful picture of "patience"** - The Greek word is
    > "hupomone", which describes the trait of one who is able to abide under the
    > weight of trials.  From the "patience of Job", we learn that it means to
    > maintain fidelity to God, even under great trials in which we do not
    > understand what is happening.

    > * **The book also prepares the way for the coming of Jesus Christ!** - His coming
    > is anticipated in several ways. Job longs for a mediator between him and
    > God (9:33; 33:23), and Jesus is one (1Ti 2:5).  Job confessed his faith in a
    > Redeemer who would one day come (19:25); Christ is that Redeemer (Ep 1:7)!
