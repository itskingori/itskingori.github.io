    Read. A lot. Go to bed every day, a little smarter than you were when you
    woke up.

    > I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes
    > not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed
    > every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does
    > that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.  
    > _~ [Charlie Munger][4]_

    But [how you read][1] matters too.

    > Consider the newspaper, are you truly learning anything new? Do you
    > consider the writer your superior when it comes to knowledge in the
    > subject? Odds are probably not. That means you're reading for information.

    > There's nothing wrong with that; it's how most people read. But you're not
    > really learning anything new. It's not going to give you an edge or make
    > you better at your job.

    > Learning something insightful is harder, you have to read something
    > clearly above your current level. You need to find writers who are more
    > knowledgeable on a particular subject than yourself. It's also [how you
    > get smarter][1].

    > Reading for understanding means narrowing the gap between reader and writer.

    Be critical and always thinking. You need to do [the mental work required to
    hold an opinion][2].

    > You're not entitled to take a view, unless and until you can argue better
    > against that view than the smartest guy who holds that opposite view. If

    Think. Especially for yourself.

    > "No," says Warren. "We don't read other people's opinions. We want to get
    > the facts, and then think." And when it gets to the thinking part, for
    > Buffett and Munger, there's no one better to think with than their
    > partners. "Charlie can't encounter a problem without thinking of an
    > answer," posits Warren. "He has the best thirty-second mind I've ever
    > seen. I'll call him up, and within thirty seconds, he'll grasp it. He just
    > sees things immediately.

    Find time to read. Invest in yourself.

    > Charlie, as a very young lawyer, was probably getting $20 an hour. He
    > thought to himself, 'Who's my most valuable client?' And he decided it was
    > himself. So he decided to sell himself an hour each day. He did it early
    > in the morning, working on these construction projects and real estate
    > deals. Everybody should do this, be the client, and then work for other
    > people, too, and sell yourself an hour a day.

    Learn to express it.

    > We read a lot. I don't know anyone who's wise who doesn't read a lot. But
    > that's not enough: You have to have a temperament to grab ideas and do
    > sensible things. Most people don't grab the right ideas or don't know what
    > to do with them.  
    > _~ [Charlie Munger][4]_

    Surround yourself with people who are not afraid to challenge your ideas.
