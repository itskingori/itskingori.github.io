    ###My Thoughts###

    I've been thinking about the effects of social media (the online culture as
    a whole) ... particularly how communication (at least in my view) is losing
    that personal/human feel. Our patience is eroding. Personally, I find it
    hard to read articles that are too long and I'd attribute this current state
    to us _'getting-used-to-140-character-tweets-posts-newsfeeds'_, which give
    us an on-demand, brief and constantly flowing update of what's happening at
    any given time - to the second.

    I'm unable to conclude if this is a good or bad thing. After all, every
    generation experiences a disruption of they way they used to do things and
    this is often coupled with the previous generation lamenting about how
    _'things were better back in my day'_. I couldn't find the words for my
    discomfort with this trend until I stumbled [on this video][1].

    He takes the words right out of my mouth. Here goes:

    > I really see Twitter, and Facebook to a slightly lesser extent, but really
    > Twitter, as routing devices for human attention. They are very good at
    > that, they are very effectively providing our species with a common
    > nervous system which we can use to transmit signals to each other. And so
    > when there's something that is a very provocative or disturbing signal or
    > a beautiful signal, it's a great system to get a lot of humans' attention
    > directed at that thing very very quickly and that can actually happen in a
    > matter of moments now or minutes. So as routing devices, Twitter and
    > Facebook are incredibly effective and I think do that very elegantly. I
    > it's as self-expressive mediums, they are less elegant. And I actually
    > don't think they are designed to be self-expressive mediums in the same
    > way that a blank piece of paper and a pen is designed to be a self-expressive
    > medium.

    ###Trend 1: Compression###

    > One thing we've seen, actually predating the web, but accentuated with the
    > web, is the compressing and shortening and speeding up of communication.
    > So you can go back to letter writing which gave way to eventually
    > telephone calls which gave way to faxes which gave way to emails which
    > gave way to text messages and chat and tweets and ... each successive
    > level gets like more and more compressed and shorter and faster and we are
    > sort of hovering at the tweet right now. And it was unclear to me that
    > there's another level of compression after that, there maybe is one more,
    > like maybe we start grunting at each other or something but ... we've
    > pretty much hit a kind of terminal velocity, I think, in terms of how fast
    > communication can go. So then you ask the quesiton like, what happens
    > after that? And do we continue to do that mode or do we hit some kind of
    > wall and bounce back in the other direction craving a little more depth
    > and substance again?

    ###Trend 2: Disposability###

    > A lot of the stuff that we put out there into the world as individuals, we
    > have this sort of complicit understanding that it's going to be swallowed
    > up and replaced moments after we publish it by the torrent of new stuff
    > that comes after it, there's the sense of just instead of expressing
    > yourself in a sort of disposable way that won't have any sort of lasting
    > impact.

    ###Trend 3: Curation###

    > So people were increasingly expressing themselves through the stuff that
    > they thought was cool. So there are web services like Pinterest and Tumblr
    > and Twitter and Facebook, which have really encouraged this type of self
    > expression in our culture. It's a lot easier than creating things directly
    > ... to assemble lists is easier than to come up with original stuff. So I
    > noticed that a lot of self expression online was taking the form of
    > curation. It's like walking into someone's apartment and judging them by
    > what they have hanging on the walls instead of talking to them.

    ###Trend 4: Self-promotion###

    > Life as an advertisement. This is something, I think we all feel, to
    > different degress, when we fill out our Facebook profiles and when we
    > develop these online personas. There's this way that we try to advertise
    > ourselves and look as awesome as we possibly can like, "Look how hot my
    > girlfriend is ... Look how wild my party was ... Look at how fun my
    > vacation was ..." all of these things. But I think that creates a lot of
    > unhealthy tendencies in people because you start comparing yourselves to
    > others,  you're always looking for ways to look cooler than you are, leads
    > insecurity and anxiety.
