    This is an attempt at being accountable to myself in regards to the simple
    desires of my heart throughout my lifetime. It is also a means for me to
    trace 'progress' and God's faithfulness over the years.

    > A number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or
    > accomplish during their lifetime. Comes from the term "kicked the bucket".

    > **bucket list**  
    > _noun_  
    > /ˈbʌkɪt lɪst/

    And in no particular order:

    * Make a bucket list - [(proof)][1]
    * Build a successful business that can operate in my absence; passive income
    * Build a family: with a [godly woman][2] (you never know these days) and kids
    * Feed my family, never should they go a day hungry
    * Educate my children
    * Educate others (especially the unfortunate - who are not my children)
    * Build a home
    * Get a motorcycle (and ride it)
    * Sky dive
    * Read the entire Bible (not as a story book but in detailed manner, almost with a theological approach)
    * Preach the [Word of God][4] (an actual sermon)
    * Fall in love
    * Speak at [TED (global)][7] about something cool I've contributed to the world
    * Achieve financial abundance with my passion
    * Mentor someone
    * Learn to cook
    * Read a book every month
    * Leave my children a legacy and good name
    * Go to bed smarter than I was when I woke up, everyday - [(hard to prove but here's how I'm doing it)][3]
