    ![Job Kin'gori Maina](http://assets.kingori.co/content/about/cover-image%402x.jpg) 

    I'm **King'ori J. Maina** ( J. for Job - it just sounds cooler that way )
    and I usually go under the alias _itsmrwave_. Sometimes, I use these aliases
    to rant [here][twitter], play around with code [here][github] ...
    occassionally share informative links [here][googleplus].

    Like my life, this (the entire collective), is a draft and probably will
    always be a work in progress, minimal so that's it's as timeless as possible
    (read _less work & laziness_) ... this was (and still is) an attempt at
    creating a portfolio of 'sorts' and occassionally ['Publishing What I
    Learn'][link1] under thoughts/articles - [here](articles/) & code minutae -
    [here](minutae/) ... when I can.

    I also love God, _**deeply**_&nbsp;&nbsp;& constantly trying to be a man of
    character ... in a world of compromise.

    When I'm not working, I'm 'jumping on monkey bars' and rocking Puma's.

    _Ps: I know your thinking .co? Yeah, I feel you 100% but some [Chinese
    Biotech first beat me to it][link2]. Sucks - but admittedly, it has a ring
    to it so I guess it all worked out after all._
