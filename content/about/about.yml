    I'm **King'ori J. Maina** _(Job King'ori Maina)_ and I usually go under the
    alias _itsmrwave_. Sometimes, I use these aliases to _'rant'_
    [here][twitter], play around with code [here][github] ... occassionally
    share informative links [here][googleplus].

    Like my life, this (the entire collective), is a draft and probably will
    always be a work in progress, minimal so that's it's as timeless as possible
    ... this was (and still is) an attempt at creating a portfolio of 'sorts'
    and occassionally ['Publishing What I Learn'][link1] under thoughts/articles
    - [here](articles/) & code minutae - [here](minutae/) ... when I can.

    I also love God, _**deeply**_&nbsp;&nbsp;& constantly trying to be a man of
    character ... in a world of compromise.

    When I'm not [riding lions][1], I _'jump on monkey bars'_ and rock Puma's.

    Correspondence can be done via [yo@kingori.co][email]. I'm based in [Nairobi,
    Kenya][2] ... if you prefer a face-to-face meet.

    _Ps: I know your thinking .co? Yeah, I feel you 100% but some [Chinese
    Biotech first beat me to it][link2]. Sucks - but admittedly, it has a ring
    to it so I guess it all worked out after all._
