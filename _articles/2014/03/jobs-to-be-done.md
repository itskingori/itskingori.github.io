###The [Jobs-to-be-Done][1] Concept

> When planning new products, companies often start by segmenting their markets
> and positioning their merchandise accordingly. This segmentation involves
> either dividing the market into product categories, such as function or price,
> or dividing the customer base into target demographics, such as age, gender,
> education, or income level.

> [...]

> "The fact that you're 18 to 35 years old with a college degree does not cause
> "you to buy a product," Christensen says. "It may be correlated with the
> "decision, but it doesn't cause it. We developed this idea because we wanted
> "to understand what causes us to buy a product, not what's correlated with it.
> "We realized that the causal mechanism behind a purchase is, 'Oh, I've got a
> "job to be done.' And it turns out that it's really effective in allowing a
> "company to build products that people want to buy."

> [...] there's an important difference between determining a product's function and
> its job. "Looking at the market from the function of a product really
> originates from your competitors or your own employees deciding what you
> need," he says. "Whereas the jobs-to-be-done point of view causes you to crawl
> into the skin of your customer and go with her as she goes about her day,
> always asking the question as she does something: Why did she do it that way?"
