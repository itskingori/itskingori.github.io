> But it's not perfect. Smart people have a problem, especially (although not
> only) when you put them in large groups. That problem is **an ability to
> convincingly rationalize nearly anything**.

> Everybody rationalizes. We all want the world to be a particular way, and we
> all make mistakes, and we all want to be successful, and we all want to feel
> good about ourselves.

> We all make decisions for emotional or intuitive reasons instead of rational
> ones. Some of us admit that. Some of us think using our emotions is better
> than being rational all the time. Some of us don't.

> Smart people, computer types anyway, tend to come down on the side of people
> who don't like emotions. Programmers, who do logic for a living.

> Here's the problem. Logic is a pretty powerful tool, but it only works if you
> give it good input. As the famous computer science maxim says, "garbage in,
> garbage out." If you know all the constraints and weights - with perfect
> precision - then you can use logic to find the perfect answer. But when you
> don't, which is always, there's a pretty good chance your logic will lead you
> very, very far astray.

> Most people find this out pretty early on in life, because their logic is
> imperfect and fails them often. But really, really smart computer geek types
> may not ever find it out. They start off living in a bubble, they isolate
> themselves because socializing is unpleasant, and, if they get a good job
> straight out of school, they may never need to leave that bubble. To such
> people, it may appear that logic actually works, and that they are themselves
> logical creatures.

> I guess I was lucky. I accidentally co-founded what turned into a pretty
> successful startup while still in school. Since I was co-running a company, I
> found out pretty fast that I was wrong about things and that the world didn't
> work as expected most of the time. This was a pretty unpleasant discovery, but
> I'm very glad I found it out earlier in life instead of later, because I might
> have wasted even more time otherwise.
