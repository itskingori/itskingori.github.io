> * You don't need to be an expert in order to achieve satisfactory investment
returns. But if you aren't, you must recognize your limitations and follow a
course certain to work reasonably well. Keep things simple and don't swing for
the fences. When promised quick profits, respond with a quick "no."

> * Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering. If you don't
feel comfortable making a rough estimate of the asset's future earnings, just
forget it and move on. No one has the ability to evaluate every investment
possibility. But omniscience isn't necessary; you only need to understand the
actions you undertake.

> * If you instead focus on the prospective price change of a contemplated purchase,
you are speculating. There is nothing improper about that. I know, however, that
I am unable to speculate successfully, and I am skeptical of those who claim
sustained success at doing so. Half of all coin-flippers will win their first
toss; none of those winners has an expectation of profit if he continues to play
the game. And the fact that a given asset has appreciated in the recent past is
never a reason to buy it.

> * With my two small investments, I thought only of what the properties would
produce and cared not at all about their daily valuations. Games are won by
players who focus on the playing field -- not by those whose eyes are glued to
the scoreboard. If you can enjoy Saturdays and Sundays without looking at stock
prices, give it a try on weekdays. Forming macro opinions or listening to the
macro or market predictions of others is a waste of time. Indeed, it is
dangerous because it may blur your vision of the facts that are truly important.
(When I hear TV commentators glibly opine on what the market will do next, I am
reminded of Mickey Mantle's scathing comment: "You don't know how easy this game
is until you get into that broadcasting booth.")
