This [pastry][2] by [Leslie Jensen-Inman][3] got me thinking about triggering
sharing during smalltalk ...

> When I travel, I always bring a book with the intention of being able to read
> while waiting for the plane to arrive and while inflight. However, I rarely
> get to read as much as I intend. Instead, I get into conversations with
> complete strangers who tell me very personal details of their lives. For
> example, on two different flights in one day, I had two separate women tell me
> about their [hysterectomies][1]. I hadn’t asked anything specific that would
> lead both women to share this very personal experience, but they both did.

> I shared these and other examples of stories that have been told to me with a
> friend. I wondered if he had similar experiences. He clearly explained,
> “People share things with you because you ask the follow-up question.”

###Furthering The Smalltalk###

Be creative with ...

* Yes/No questions
* What?
* How?
* Why?
* Where?
* When?
* Meaning?
* And?

Then simply rinse and repeat ... obviously, after letting the person finish
speaking.

###Listening###

1. Make eye contact while the other person speaks. In general, you should
aim for eye contact about 60-70% of the time that you are listening. Lean
toward the other person, and nod your head occasionally. Avoid folding your
arms as this signals that you are not listening.
2. Instead of offering unsolicited advice or opinions, simply paraphrase
what has been said. You might start this off by saying "In other words, what
you are saying is...".
3. Do not interrupt while the other person is speaking. Do not prepare your
reply while the other person speaks; the last thing that he says may change
the meaning of what he has already said.
4. In addition to listening to what is said, watch nonverbal behavior to
pick up on hidden meaning. Facial expressions, tone of voice and other
behaviors can sometimes tell you more than words alone.
5. While listening, shut down your internal dialogue. Avoid daydreaming. It
is impossible to attentively listen to someone else and your own internal
voice at the same time.
6. Show interest by asking questions to clarify what is said. Ask open-ended
questions to encourage the speaker. Avoid closed yes-or-no questions that
tend to shut down conversation.
7. Avoid abruptly changing the subject; it will appear that you were not
listening to the other person.
8. As you listen, be open, neutral, and withhold judgment and stereotypes.

###Tips###

1. Show interest and encourage the other person to speak by smiling and
nodding during conversation.
2. It will be easier to ask yes/no and follow-up questions if you keep up-
to-date on news, entertainment and sporting events.
3. If there isn't a natural follow-up question, and the other person is
still speaking, interject statements such as "Tell me more" or "Sounds
interesting" to encourage the other person.
4. If someone discloses something personal, such as a recent death in the
family or a divorce, it is usually best to offer sympathy and support rather
than ask for more details, unless you know the person very well. That person
may just want to explain his situation so that you know why he is not acting
like himself. Leave it up to him to decide how much to share.
5. Be patient while you listen. We are capable of listening much faster than
others can speak.
6. Learn to recognize active listening. Watch television interviews and
observe whether the interviewer is practicing active listening. Learn from
the mistakes of others.
