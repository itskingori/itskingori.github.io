> The sales director of the Flemington Nissan dealership in the central New
> Jersey town of Flemington is a man named Bob Golomb. [...] Since starting in
> the car business more than a decade ago, Golomb has sold, on average, about
> twenty cars a month, which is more than double what the average car salesman
> sells. On his desk Golomb has a row of five gold stars, given to him by his
> dealership in honor of his performance. In the world of car salesmen, Golomb
> is a virtuoso.

> [...]

> He’s the Evelyn Harrison of car selling. He has a quiet, watchful intelligence
> and a courtly charm. He is thoughtful and attentive. He’s a wonderful
> listener. He has, he says, three simple rules that guide his every action:
> “Take care of the customer. Take care of the customer. Take care of the
> customer.” If you buy a car from Bob Golomb, he will be on the phone to you
> the next day, making sure everything is all right. If you come to the
> dealership but don’t end up buying anything, he’ll call you the next day,
> thanking you for stopping by. “You always put on your best face, even if you
> are having a bad day. You leave that behind,” he says. “Even if things are
> horrendous at home, you give the customer your best.”

From [Blink: The Power Of Thinking Without Thinking][1] by Malcolm Gladwell.
Even if you don't sell cars, there's something that you can pick from that
little excerpt.
