> The rarest of these specialists, he says, is an authentic genius -- a person
> capable of having seemingly good ideas not in general circulation. "A genius
> working alone," he says, "is invariably ignored as a lunatic."

> The second sort of specialist is a lot easier to find: a highly intelligent
> citizen in good standing in his or her community, who understands and admires
> the fresh ideas of the genius, and who testifies that the genius is far from
> mad. "A person like this working alone," says Slazinger, "can only yearn loud
> for changes, but fail to say what their shapes should be."

> The third sort of specialist is a person who can explain everything, no matter
> how complicated, to the satisfaction of most people, no matter how stupid or
> pigheaded they may be. "He will say almost anything in order to be interesting
> and exciting," says Slazinger. "Working alone, depending solely on his own
> shallow ideas, he would be regarded as being as full of shit as a Christmas
> turkey."
