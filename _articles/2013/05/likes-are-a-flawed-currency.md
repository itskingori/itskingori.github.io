#####Recommendations and Favourites#####

Favourites are your personal way of saving the what you love to a place where
you can easily find them again.

A recommendation differs in that it doesn’t necessarily have to be a what that
you love, but more so a photograph which you believe is technically good and
should be seen by other people.
