> There's a great moment in a [Michael Lewis][3] interview that I heard recently

> Short][1] after the devastating picture of Wall Street he'd painted in his
> first book, [Liar's Poker][2], nearly twenty years earlier? You have to

> the financial industry after reading his book. Their big takeaway was how easy
> it was to make a lot of money without regard to the niceties of creating much
> value. He finished with the memorable line, "You never know what book you
> wrote until you know what book people read."

> That turned out to be a major problem for me at O’Reilly. I talked so much

> everyone understood that we were still a business. Even when I said things

An interesting perspective of the value that you create. This is just an excerpt
from [How I Failed][4] by [Tim O'Reilly][5].
