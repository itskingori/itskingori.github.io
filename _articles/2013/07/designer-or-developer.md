> Designers and developers—like any other group of people—shouldn’t be
> pigeonholed into separate roles. Doing so is damaging to individuals, your
> company, and the entire industry. **Quality products and cultures thrive on
> employing people with a broad set of skills and at least one specialization.
> Embrace the sliding spectrum of skills.**

> I typically think of myself as a designer, but I spend most of my time writing
> code. Does that make me less of a designer? No, that makes me more
> knowledgeable about the medium I work on. Any experienced worker from nearly
> any industry knows how paramount that can be. Know your craft—it’s goal,
> medium, impact, and end product.

> **Bottom line? Get talented people together that can have fun and ship awesome
shit, and good things will follow. Don’t worry about the labels.**
