If everyone, is busy making everything,  
how can anyone perfect anything?  

We start to confuse convenience with joy,  
abundance with choice.  
Designing something requires focus.  
The first thing we ask is,  
what do we want people to feel?  
Delight. Surprise. Love. Connection.  
Then we begin to craft around our intention.  
It takes time ...  
There are a thousand no-s for every yes.  
We simplify.  
We perfect.  
We start over, until everything we touch,  
enhances each life it touches.  

Only then do we sign our work.
