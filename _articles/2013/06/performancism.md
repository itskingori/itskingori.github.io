> Dr. Richard Leahy, a prominent psychologist and anxiety specialist was quoted

> What I see more than anything else is an unquestioning embrace of
> performanicism in all sectors of life. **Performancism is the mindset that
> equates our identity and value directly with our performance and
> accomplishments**. Performancism casts achievements not as something we do or
> don’t do but as something we are (or aren’t). The colleges those teenagers
> eventually attend will be more than the place where they are educated— – they
> will be the labels which define their value as a human being, both in the eyes
> of their peers, their parents, and themselves. The money we earn, the car we
> drive, isn’t merely reflective of our occupation,; it is reflective of us,
> period. How we look, how intelligent we are, and what people think of us is
> more than descriptive,; it is synonymous with our worth. In the word of
> performancism, success equals life, and failure is tantamount to death. This
> is the reason why people would rather end their lives than confess that
> they’ve lost their job, or made a bad investment.

> This is not to say that accomplishments are somehow bad, or even that they
> aren’t incredibly important. It is simply to say that there is a difference
> between taking pride in what we do and worshiping it. When we worship at the
> altar of performance—and make no mistake, performancism is a form of worship —
> we spend our lives frantically propping up our image or reputation, trying to
> do it all, and do it all well, often at a cost to ourselves and those we love.
> Life becomes a hamster wheel of endless earning and proving and maintenance
> and management and controlling, where all we can see is our own feet.
> Performancism causes us to live in a constant state of anxiety, fear, and
> resentment, until we end up heavily medicated, in the hospital, or just
> really, really unhappy.
