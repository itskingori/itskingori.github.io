> **Publish what you learn and don’t be afraid to make mistakes**. Publish to
your personal blog and keep your posts updated. Be sure to speak with your own
voice! Remember that it is okay to not be an absolute authority on a subject to
author a post! Always ask questions and prompt conversations. There is seldom a
wrong question or a wrong answer.

> Teaching is a great learning tool as well. So, even if you are getting
> started in an area, you’re helping yourself by writing about it as well.
> You can always consider asking a mentor or friend for a technical review.
