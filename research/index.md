I'm part of the [UCT ICT4D Lab][1] which serves as a focal point for
researchers who wish to create Information and Communication Technologies that
address problems in the African Continent and other developing regions.

The lab is a multi-disciplinary centre that seeks to create new technologies for
the developing world, as well as study the impacts of existing technology.

Also currently doing my Masters in Computer Science.
