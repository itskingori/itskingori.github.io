    > **Matthew 6:9-13**  
    >
    > Our Father in heaven _(God's Paternity)_  
    > Hallowed be your name _(God's Priority)_  
    > Your kingdom come _(God's Program)_  
    > Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven _(God's Purpose)_  
    > Give us this day our daily bread _(God's Provision)_  
    > And forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven our debtors _(God's Pardon)_  
    > And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil _(God's Protection)_  
    > For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever _(God's Pre-eminence)_  

    ~ John MacArthur.
