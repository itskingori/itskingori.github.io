> If you are stuck drowning in too much data and too many options and are
> dazzled by all the possibilities of code, here's a helpful bit of advice
> from Airbnb's rags to riches origin story: it's okay to do things that
> donâ€™t scale.

> A corollary is the idea of paying attention to and learning from what your
> users are actually doing and let that lead you without out that annoying
> voice in your head second guessing you, yelling but that will never scale!
> Worry about building something good, then worry about making it scale.

> In Airbnb's case they noticed people weren't booking rooms because the
> pictures sucked. So they flew to New York and shot some beautiful images.
> This is a very non-scalable and non-technical solution. Yet it was the
> turning point for Airbnb and sparked their climb out of the "trough of
> sorrow." Previously they had been limited by the Silicon Valley idea that
> every feature had to be scalable. **Not every solution can be found behind a
> computer screen.**
