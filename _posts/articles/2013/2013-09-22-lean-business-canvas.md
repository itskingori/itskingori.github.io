Lessons from [Ash Maurya][7], author of [Running Lean][8] [(book)][9] and founder
of [Sparks59][10]. Follow him on twitter as [@ashmaurya][7].

* Life's too short to built something nobody wants.
* Ideas are cheap but acting on them is really expensive.
* Most startups/products fail.
* Most plan A's don't work.
* Most that succeed drastically change their plan along the way.
* Most fail not because they fail to build what they set out to build, but because they spend too much time, money, and effort building the wrong product.
* Those that succeed are those that are able to find a plan that works before running out of resources.
* Finding a plan that works involves getting [empirical evidence][11] from people other than yourself (team, advisors, customers) and then refining the plan using the feedback.
* _"There is no such thing as a failed experiment, only unexpected outcomes."_ - [Buckminster Fuller][6]
* Time is the scarcest resource therefore [time-box][12] the initial canvas so that you don't fall under [analysis-paralysis][13].
* Perfection is not the goal.
* The media loves stories of visionaries who see the future and chart a perfect course to intersect it but that is not reality.
* The perfect plan is a myth.
* True unfair advantages are rarely built from the solution because often the solution is purposely defined in such a manner that there's no competition (possibly leading to false positives).
* Being first to market is not necessarily an advantage (proven by history).
* Investors don't care about the solution. They are in the business of making a return on their investment.
* Customers don't care about the solution. They care about products that solve their problems.
* A customer's value preposition (promise) is an intersection of a customer's top problems and your top solutions.
* Your [UVP (Unique Value Preposition)][20] needs to be unique and needs to matter.
* [MVP (Minimal Viable Product)][21] is the smallest solution that you can build that still delivers the customer promise.
* The true product of an entrepreneur isn't the solution, but a working business model.
* The true job of an entrepreneur is systematically de-risking that business model over time over a series of converations (building a successful product is fundamentally about risk mitigation).
* While passion and determination are key attributes of success, left unchecked they can also turn the journey into a faith based one largely driven by [dogma][14] as opposed to facts.
* Entrepreneurs are obsessed with the solution (also known as _'the awesome'_).
* Users are not customers. Customers pay.
* _"A problem well stated is a problem half solved."_ - [Charles Kettering][15]
* Avoid empty marketing promises like _'fast'_, _'simple'_ and _'easy'_. You are not Apple. They get away with it because they've built a brand around simplicity.
* Always have a [high-concept pitch][22] but don't place it in your pitch.
* Pricing is part of your product.
* Pricing determines your customers.
* Customers naturally compare your product to existing alternatives, not what it cost you to deliver your solution.
* Position your solution against existing alternatives.
* Keep your pricing simple.
* Have key metrics, they tell you how well you are doing.
* Always have a success metric. Begin with an end in mind by defining success.
* _"A real unfair advantage is something that cannot be easily copied or bought."_ - [Jason Cohen][16]
* Unfair advantages can be built over time.
* Unfair advantages are not testable. They are revealed by copycats and competition.
* When you try market to everyone you end up marketing to no one.
* Initial adopters define your initial model.
* An [early adopter][17] is someone who wants your product so badly that they are able to tolerate a less that perfect version and jump through hoops if needed.
* A [business][23] is not a [hobby][24].
* Good marketing is essentially about connecting with your customer's needs and de-risking the offer so that they pick you over the alternative.
* There's a difference between risk and uncertainty. High uncertainty doesn't always mean high risk.
* Uncertainty is the lack of complete certainty i.e. the existence of more than one possibility.
* Risk is a quantifiable state of uncertainty i.e. where we can qualify a certain value to being wrong and the possible outcomes could be an undesirable outcome.
* While everything on a business canvas is uncertain, not every aspect is uncertain to the same degree (from a risk perspective).
* Product risk involves getting the product right (product, solution, UVP, cost structure, revenue streams).
* Customer risk involves building a path to the customer (channels, customer segments, early adopters).
* Market risk involves building a viable business for a certain market (existing alternatives, key metrics, cost structure, revenue streams, unfair advantage).
* Charge for your product from day one as opposed to hiding behind alpha/beta excuse.
* Testing if people will pay is a learning goal, testing for the optimum price is an optimisation goal.
* Uncover risks that you don't know about by having conversations with other people e.g. advisors.
* A slide deck, assumes context that is best communicated in person. Prefer meeting over email.
* _"Advisor Paradox: Hire advisors for advice but don't follow it, apply it."_ - [Venture Hacks][18]
* _"If you can't describe what you do as a process you don't know what you are doing."_ - [Edward Deming][19]
