**No matter how complex the processes or magical the output is, ultimately,
it can and should be reduced to a set of rules, for continuity sake.**

Any organisation (community or company) needs a sort of [M.O. ★][2] for the sake
of effeciency and to have the ability to respond and recover from any sudden
changes in the operations or workforce.

On that note, I wrote an [M.O. ★][2] ... it boils down to the following.

### [Guidelines][3]

* [Best Practice][4] - techniques that have consistently shown results
* [Code Review][5] - how to examine each others code
* [Convention][6] - that which is considered acceptable or polite to most
* [Style][7] - easy to read and good to look at

### [The Top Layer][8]

* Be consistent.
* Teach, if you can.
* Publish what you learn.
* Many heads are inevitably better than one.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow the code guidelines.
* Code well. Everyone leaves. Your last duty should be to hand it off to a competent successor.
* Don't wait for crisis to change, adopt an M.O. asap and stay safe.

### [Language][8]

* _"Avoid"_ means don't do it unless you have good reason.
* _"Don't"_ means there's never a good reason.
* _"Prefer"_ indicates there's a better option, you can evaluate it's pros and cons.
* _"Use"_ is a positive instruction.
* _"Limit"_ is a caution against excesses.
* _"Team"_ comprises a group of people linked in a common purpose.
* Lack of _"Avoid"_, _"Don't"_, _"Prefer"_, _"Use"_ or _"Limit"_ implies a rule.
