> “When I was a young entrepreneur, board meetings were by far the worst days of
my life,” says Jeff Bonforte, the veteran company-builder who just sold his
latest, Xobni, to Yahoo. “Board meetings are the height of insecurity for a CEO.
Basically it’s a group of people who can both judge you and fire you based on
that judgment.”

> He’s had his fair share of bad experiences. At his first company, iDrive, he'd
> find himself every quarter standing in front of the room, sweating bullets,
> struggling to get through his meticulously-prepared slides. “It was a mess,”
> he says. “They’d just sit there and tell me how insufficient I was, how I
> needed to bring in someone more senior, or smarter. Then it just hit me. I
> don't need this. I don't need people to attack me for four straight hours. I
> need people who can help me.”

> This shift in philosophy has shaped the way Bonforte has handled his board
> members and meetings ever since. The core of his new strategy: Your success as
> a CEO is contingent on your board doing their best to help you — so put them
> to work. Of course, this is easier said than done.
