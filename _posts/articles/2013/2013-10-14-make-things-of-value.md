> To produce better digital work, I've lately found myself thinking analog.
> Technology makes it so simple and seamless to build platforms and disseminate

> knee-jerk reactions to buzzwords. "Build an app." "Tweet that." "Post this."
> "Make a microsite for it." The result? Clutter. Content that exists because it

> leaves out a very important qualifier: "make things of value."
