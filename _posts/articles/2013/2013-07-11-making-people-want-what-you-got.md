> _**How to boost desire using the psychology of scarcity**_

> Interested in boosting customer desire? A classic study reveals an
> interesting quirk of human behavior that may hold a clue.

> In 1975, researchers [Worchel, Lee, and Adewole][1] wanted to know how
> people would value cookies in two identical glass jars. One jar held ten
> cookies while the other contained just two stragglers. Which cookies would
> people value more?

> Though the cookies and jars were identical, participants valued the ones
> in the near-empty jar more highly. Scarcity had somehow affected their
> perception of value.
