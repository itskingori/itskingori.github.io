[From Wikipedia][5]:

> **This Is Water: Some Thoughts, Delivered on a Significant Occasion, about
> Living a Compassionate Life** is an essay by [David Foster Wallace][1], first
> published in book form by [Little, Brown and Company][2] in 2009. The text
> originates from a commencement speech given by Wallace at Kenyon College on
> May 21, 2005. Before Little, Brown's publication, a transcript of the speech
> circulated around the Internet. The essay was also published in The Best
> American Nonrequired Reading 2006.[[1][3]]

> This essay covers subjects including "the difficulty of empathy," "the
> importance of being well adjusted," and "the essential lonesomeness of adult
> life."[[1][3]] Additionally, Wallace's speech suggests that the overall
> purpose of higher education is to be able to consciously choose how to
> perceive others, think about meaning, and act appropriately in everyday life.
> He argues that the true freedom acquired through education is the ability to
> be adjusted, conscious, and sympathetic.[[2][4]]
