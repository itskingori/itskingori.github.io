The highlights ...

> In truth, ours is a chronically weak economy that has often succeeded in
> posting high growth, but still struggles to meet most of the demands of the
> ordinary citizen.

> We have had quantitative growth, but not qualitative development. Fifty years
> later, our economy’s biggest weakness is its inability to provide decent jobs
> for its citizens. More than ever before, many Kenyans are having to put up
> with low-paying, low quality jobs.

###Quality Of Jobs###

> Every so often, our economists reel out statistics showing how hundreds of
> thousands of jobs are created in the informal sector. But do we even pause to
> ask about the quality of jobs in the informal sector — working conditions,
> working hours, or the return on effort?

> The truth is that work in the informal sector is characterised by maximum
> physical exertion, inhuman working hours and meagre returns on effort.

###Spending###

> We have done very well in terms of jerking up infrastructure spending. We have
> a fairly strong financial sector, but the growth of public sector debt as a
> percentage of GDP is just too high.

###The Way Forward###

> Policy must seek to eliminate this sector so that we can move citizens away
> from the beastly working conditions to sectors that can offer decent and
> durable jobs.
