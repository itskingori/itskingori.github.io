###Mediocre Ideas###

> Truly great ideas are rare. Jokers like us will probably never have one.
> That’s OK. We have mediocre ones all the time and they work just fine. I once
> had an idea to start a blog about CSS. I sucked at writing. I sucked at
> designing. The vibe at the time was that everything important about CSS had
> already been written. Nobody told me.

###Showing Up###

> I didn’t just have the idea, I did it. That’s the showing up part. Hands on
> the keyboard, go. I barely knew what I was doing. I stumbled through even
> following simple walkthroughs on how to install the software. Executing your
> ideas is never overly comfortable.

###Persistence###

> Then never stop. Don’t get distracted by some other idea and prance away to
> that tomorrow. Keep doing it until you’ve done everything you set out to do
> and everyone and their mom knows it. I didn’t stop blogging when barely anyone
> read it for years. I didn’t stop when people told me I was dumb or wrong. I
> didn’t stop when redesigns were met with vitriol. I didn’t stop when faced
> with mountainous challenges like inexplicable server failure, legal trouble,
> and theft of the site itself.
