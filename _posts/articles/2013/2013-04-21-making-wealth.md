One of the most brilliant articles I have ever read by [Paul
Graham][paulgraham]. Literally, changed my life &amp; my perceptions about
technology, renumeration, hard-work ... to say the least.

We could also call this _'18 Lessons on Wealth from Paul Graham'_.

_Emphasis, mine._

### Lesson #1: Startups &amp; Life

> Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole
> working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty
> years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially
> well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.

> ...

> _Startups are not magic_. They don't change the laws of wealth creation. They
> just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation
> law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a
> million dollars' worth of pain.

> ...

> If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.

### Lesson #2: How To, Summarized

> The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it's
> more legitimate (many of the other methods are now illegal) but that it's more
> straightforward. _You just have to do something people want_.

### Lesson #3: Wealth Is NOT Money

> Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes,
> houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have
> wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command
> make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you
> wanted, you wouldn't need money.

> ...

> Wealth is what you want, not money. _But if wealth is the important thing, why
> does everyone talk about making money?_ It is a kind of shorthand: money is a
> way of moving wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable. But
> they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by
> counterfeiting, talking about making money can make it harder to understand
> how to make money.

### Lesson #4: The Pie Fallacy

> A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a
> fixed amount of wealth in the world. There is, in any normal family, a fixed
> amount of money at any moment. But that's not the same thing.

> ...

> Suppose you own a beat-up old car. Instead of sitting on your butt next
> summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In
> doing so you create wealth. The world is-- and you specifically are-- one
> pristine old car the richer. And not just in some metaphorical way. If you
> sell your car, you'll get more for it.

### Lesson #5: What Is A Job?

> But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying reality.
> In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other
> people's. You may not even be aware you're doing something people want. Your
> contribution may be indirect. But the company as a whole must be giving people
> something they want, or they won't make any money. And if they are paying you
> x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars
> a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and
> will go out of business.

> Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a
> job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution. _A
> more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people
> want. You don't need to join a company to do that._ All a company is is a
> group of people working together to do something people want. _It's doing
> something people want that matters, not joining the group._

### Lesson #6: The 'Working Harder' Misconception &amp; The Value of Work

> That averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem
> afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each
> person's work. For the most part they punt. In a big company you get paid a
> fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard. You're expected not to be
> obviously incompetent or lazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole
> life to your work.

> It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your
> life you devote to your work. In the right kind of business, someone who
> really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as
> much wealth as an average employee.

> Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this. You can't go to
> your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten times as hard, so will you
> please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that
> you are already working as hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that
> the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.

> Salesmen are an exception. It's easy to measure how much revenue they
> generate, and they're usually paid a percentage of it.

> There is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first- rate
> people: in the top management jobs. And for the same reason: their performance
> can be measured. The top managers are held responsible for the performance of
> the entire company. Because an ordinary employee's performance can't usually
> be measured, he is not expected to do more than put in a solid effort. Whereas
> top management, like salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers.
> The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in a solid effort. If
> the company does badly, he's done badly.

> _If you want to go faster, it's a problem to have your work tangled together
> with a large number of other people's. In a large group, your performance is
> not separately measurable-- and the rest of the group slows you down._

### Lesson #7: Measurement &amp; Leverage

> To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things,
> measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance
> can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you
> have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big
> effect.

> I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a
> situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs,
> movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the
> presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by
> downside, so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a
> terrifying possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all
> live with the sword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck,
> they're out. If you're in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get
> rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.

> _But you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with
> measurement and leverage. All you need to do is be part of a small group
> working on a hard problem._

### Lesson #8: Smallness = Measurement

> If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you
> can get close. You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.

> ...

> Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to
> saying to one's boss, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten
> times as much. There are two differences: you're not saying it to your boss,
> but directly to the customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all),
> and you're not doing it individually, but along with a small group of other
> ambitious people.

> It will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like
> acting or writing books, you can't be a company of one person. _And the people
> you work with had better be good, because it's their work that yours is going
> to be averaged with._

> _That's the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting together with a
> group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot
> more, than they would in a big company. And because startups tend to get
> founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one
> another (at least by reputation), the level of measurement is more precise
> than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten
> people like you._

### Lesson #9: Technology = Leverage

> _What is technology? It's technique._ It's the way we all do things. And when
> you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people
> who use it. It is the proverbial fishing rod, rather than the fish. That's the
> difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs
> or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem
> that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution.
> _That's leverage._

> _If you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating
> wealth did it by developing new technology. You just can't fry eggs or cut
> hair fast enough._

### Lesson #10: Bureaucracy

> ... Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don't have
layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come
from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by
convention.

> Big companies can develop technology. They just can't do it quickly. Their
> size makes them slow and prevents them from rewarding employees for the
> extraordinary effort required. So in practice big companies only get to
> develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups
> from competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants, or passenger
> aircraft. And even in those fields they depend heavily on startups for
> components and ideas.

### Lesson #11: Difficulty As A Guide

> Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your
> company, but also at decision points along the way.

> ...

> What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought hard problems. If
> there were two features we could add to our software, both equally valuable in
> proportion to their difficulty, we'd always take the harder one. Not just
> because it was more valuable, but because it was harder. We delighted in
> forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like
> guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the
> troops of the central government can't follow. I can remember times when we
> were just exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical
> problem. And I'd be delighted, because something that was hard for us would be
> impossible for our competitors.

### Lesson #12: Patents &amp; Competition

> Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If you can develop
> technology that's simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need
> to rely on other defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every
> decision point, take the harder choice.

### Lesson #13: The Catch(es) - of The Startup Route

#### Catch 1

> ... you can't choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You
can't decide, for example, that you'd like to work just two or three times as
hard, and get paid that much more. When you're running a startup, your
competitors decide how hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same
decision: as hard as you possibly can.

#### Catch 2

> ... the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity. There
is, as I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company.
So in practice the deal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get paid
30 times as much. It is that you're 30 times as productive, and get paid between
zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 30x, the median is probably
zero. Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood portals we all heard about
during the Internet Bubble. It's common for a startup to be developing a
genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and
have to shut down.

#### Catch 3

> A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored
> against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score. No energy is
> wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos, as a species, is that there are a
> lot of them, but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.

#### Catch 4

> ... companies doing acquisitions are not looking for bargains. A company big
enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and
within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more
conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the
company late. They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So it is easier to
sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one.

### Lesson #14: To Sell Or Not To Sell?

> ... it's a good idea to get bought, if you can. Running a business is
different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over
once you reach cruising altitude. It's also financially wiser, because selling
allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all
his client's assets into one volatile stock?

### Lesson #15: How To Get Bought

> Mostly by doing the same things you'd do if you didn't intend to sell the
> company. Being profitable, for example. But getting bought is also an art in
> its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying to master.

> Potential buyers will always delay if they can. The hard part about getting
> bought is getting them to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator is
> not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss. For potential acquirers, the most
> powerful motivator is the prospect that one of their competitors will buy you.
> This, as we found, causes CEOs to take red-eyes. The second biggest is the
> worry that, if they don't buy you now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and
> will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor.

### Lesson #16: Get Users

> ... it all comes down to is users. You'd think that a company about to buy you
would do a lot of research and decide for themselves how valuable your
technology was. Not at all. What they go by is the number of users you have.

> In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology.
> And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users are the only real proof that
> you've created wealth. Wealth is what people want, and if people aren't using
> your software, maybe it's not just because you're bad at marketing. Maybe it's
> because you haven't made what they want.

> ...

> Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will be very close. It's
> what acquirers care about. It's what revenues depend on. It's what makes
> competitors unhappy. It's what impresses reporters, and potential new users.
> Certainly it's a better test than your a priori notions of what problems are
> important to solve, no matter how technically adept you are.

### Lesson #17: Premature Optimization

> ... Now we can recognize this as something hackers already know to avoid:
premature optimization. Get a version 1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until
you have some users to measure, you're optimizing based on guesses.

> _The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying principle that
> wealth is what people want._

> A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in
> technology, you cook one thing and that's what everyone eats. So any
> difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied. You
> please or annoy customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want,
> the more wealth you generate.

### Lesson #18: Wealth &amp; Power (with some history)

> Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it
> has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources
> of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to
> acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or
> confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.

> Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For most of the world's
> history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his henchmen
> would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A
> new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns. [10]
> Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord. So for the first
> time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds' lunch money. This
> was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the
> second big change, industrialization.

> A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial Revolution.
> But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made
> fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace. One piece of evidence is what
> happened to countries that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet
> Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of the 1960s
> and early 1970s. Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation
> grinds to a halt.

> Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew
> so powerful. Was it something about the geography of Europe? Was it that
> Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion? The answer (or
> at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans rode on the crest of a
> powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.

> _Once you're allowed to do that, people who want to get rich can do it by
> generating wealth instead of stealing it._

> _... Don't let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the
> entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries
> powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world._
