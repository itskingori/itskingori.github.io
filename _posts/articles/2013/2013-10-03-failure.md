> The first comes from never trying out your ideas because you are afraid, or
> because you are waiting for the perfect time. This kind of failure you can
> never learn from, and such timidity will destroy you. The second kind comes
> from a bold and venturesome spirit. If you fail in this way, the hit that you
> take to your reputation is greatly outweighed by what you learn. Repeated
> failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things
> must be done. In fact, it is a curse to have everything go right on your first
> attempt. You will fail to question the element of luck, making you think that
> you have the golden touch. When you do inevitably fail, it will confuse and
> demoralize you past the point of learning. In any case, to apprentice as an
> entrepreneur you must act on your ideas as early as possible, exposing them to
> the public, a part of you even hoping that youâ€™ll fail. You have everything to
> gain.
