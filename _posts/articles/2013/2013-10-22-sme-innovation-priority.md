> He said: "Innovation has become a really important way of communicating
> with customers. Sales rarely happen these days as a result of a single
> moment; they are nearly always dependent on dialogue, conversation and
> rapport with your customers."

> He added: "Being innovative enables you to have ongoing conversations with
> customers who aren't going to be irritated by the intrusion and will
> instead be curious or even delighted to hear from you, because people want
> to know what's new. They like the idea of being thought of as early
> adopters."

> Devonshire said that SMEs relying on the launch of one product a year to
> take their business forward should think again, saying that businesses
> should ideally be creating new products and services, or ways of getting
> them to customers, twice a quarter. "I would encourage small businesses to
> innovate their proposition once every six weeks. Six weeks in the life of
> a customer is a long time. If you are only launching one initiative a year
> to grow your business you are asking a lot of it."
