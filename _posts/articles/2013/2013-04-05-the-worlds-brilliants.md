> In his classic Innocents Abroad, Mark Twain wrote one of his most famous
> lines: "Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things can not be
> acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."

> TED is anchored by the belief that brilliance is a public good — that
> inspiration, intellectualism, passion and the wonder of discovery are gifts
> that everyone should share and participate in. Just as important, however, is
> its affirmation that smart is not the domain of one or two or even three
> disciplines, but comes in all shapes and sizes and often from unexpected
> places. The enlightened mind does not, to paraphrase Twain, vegetate in one
> little field or industry of the earth all its lifetime.

> We live in a moment when the awesome power of technology and the pressure of
> global competitiveness have focused our attention on the importance of hard
> disciplines. Our politicians push for emphasis on math and science in
> classrooms. If these improvements are essential, however, the conversation
> around them risks drowning out the all-important message that the world is
> beautiful because of the diversity of passion in it — that alongside engineers
> we need oboe players, and that for all of our artificial intelligence, we need
> choreographers who remind us how majestic human creation is all by itself.
