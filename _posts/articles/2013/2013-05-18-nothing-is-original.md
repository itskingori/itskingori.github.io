#### COPY. TRANSFORM. COMBINE.

> The act of creation is surrounded by a fog of myths. Myths that creativity
> comes via inspiration ... that original creations break the mould ... that
> they are the products of geniuses ... and appears quickly as electricity can
> heat a filament _but_ creativity isn't magic.

> It happens by applying ordinary tools of thought to existing materials. And
> the soil from which we grow our creations is something we scorn and
> misunderstand even when it gives us so much, and that's ... copying.

> Put simply, copying is how we learn we can't introduce anything new until we
> are fluent in the language of our domain. And we do that through emulation.
> For instance all artists spend their formative years producing derivative
> work.

> I _invented nothing new_.

> I simply assembled the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries
> of work. Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have
> failed.

> So it is with every new thing. Progress happens when all the factors that
> make for it are ready and then it is inevitable.

> To teach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the greatest
> forward steps of manking is the worst sort of nonsense.
