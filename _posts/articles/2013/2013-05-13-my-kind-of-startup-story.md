> I want a story about a person that struggled for many years. That made lots of
> mistakes. That learned lessons the hard way. That eventually combined the
> right idea with the right execution in the right market to make a living. Not
> buy a boat you can land a helicopter on. Not conquer the world with iPads.
> Just make a living. The real startup story that most people live.

> In the startup community, we keep emphasizing the dramatic, the kids out of
> college cashing in on a billion-dollar IPO. But hell, that's not the story
> that any of us who are actually doing the work are actually living. We need
> more realistic success stories if we truly want to help each other out.

> Tell me more of those stories. _Please_.
