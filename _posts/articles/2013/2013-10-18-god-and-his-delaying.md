> _"Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him,
> He said to Philip, ‘Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?’ But
> this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do."_  
> _John 6:5,6_

> When we see a need we grow frustrated. But when Jesus sees a need He
> already knows what He wants to do. Not only will He meet the need, but He
> will reveal Himself in the process. Sometimes He will leave the need
> unmet, at least for a season, and just reveal Himself to us as All that we
> need (2 Corinthians 12:8,9).

> This explains why it sometimes appears that the Lord delays in answering
> us. He already knows what He is going to do, but we do not know. He waits
> for us to see if we will trust Him as Infinite Supply. Is Jesus “Lord”
> only after He answers us? Or is Jesus “Lord” whether He answers us or not?
> The Lord’s “proving ground” is just there, in between the Need and the
> Answer. And sometimes it is, indeed, quite a stretching, and a thorough
> test.
