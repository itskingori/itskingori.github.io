A culture of entrepreneurship is growing in Sub-Saharan Africa, with
indicators related to entrepreneurial motivations at least on par with or
higher than global peers. However, despite these positive signs, the
business landscape in Sub-Saharan Africa provides a number of challenges
that prospective entrepreneurs must transcend.

The greatest challenge facing entrepreneurs across Africa is the state of
entrepreneurial assets:

1. Financing
2. Skills and talent
3. Infrastructure

###Financing###

####Cost Of Funding Is Prohibitive####

* While many Afro-entrepreneurs bemoan a limited supply of capital, financiers
point out that many projects are not fundable.

* While the majority of Afro-entrepreneurs in five of the six countries
indicate that they know of organisations and programmes that can direct them
to sources of capital, they cite the cost of funding as a primary reason
they are reluctant to access, or even explore, different avenues of funding.
The cost of capital charged by banks and investors is often so high that it
impedes the entrepreneur’s profitability.

* Government funding is viewed as difficult to access due to bureaucracy and
nepotism (only 5% of survey respondents used government funding).

* Many entrepreneurs admit to being unaware of alternative funding options
available from government or private sources, other than banks.

####Access To Finance Remains A Dilemma####

* The risk-reward structure of banks makes them reticent to invest in start-up
ventures. If one considers the fact that banks’ earnings are capped on loans
made, and that nine out of 10 ventures fail within five years of operation,
the risks are exceedingly high and do not offer a corresponding reward.
Banks make loans using depositors’ savings, which are put at considerable
risk if they invest heavily in entrepreneurial ventures.

* Venture capital, where investors share the risk but also the gain on the
equity upside, provides a more appropriate source of financing which is
relatively small. Only 33% of respondents in the survey believe
that there is sufficient supply of venture capital.

####Communication Plays A Vital Role In Accessing Capital####

* Funders need to perform a thorough due diligence on companies in which they
invest. Their stringent requirements are designed to reveal the extent to
which an entrepreneur understands his or her business model, industry and
external regulatory environment. Yet, while a financier may discredit an
entrepreneur who does not meet his or her checklist of requirements, it is
presumptuous to expect that many entrepreneurs understand these
requirements. Entrepreneurs may not be thinking about their businesses along
the same structured lines as financiers, thereby running the risk of
discounting this type of funding as prohibitive or even impossible. Many of
these misperceptions and misunderstandings can be mitigated by enhanced
communication.

####The Power Of Networks Is Critical To Shaping An Entrepreneur’s Horizon####

* The size of an idea is shaped by the resources — financially and otherwise —
that an entrepreneur has at his or her disposal to nurture the idea and
bring it to life. If an entrepreneur believes that he or she can raise USD
5,000, the idea gets adjusted accordingly; if he or she has access to USD
500 thousand, however, the idea is likely to be larger. This poses
difficulty for entrepreneurs who do not have a network of potential
investors and mentors beyond their family and friends, as their ventures
face a higher chance of stagnation.

###Skills & Talent###

####The Culture Of Innovation Is Lacking In Schools####

* Stakeholders generally agree that the education system tends to focus on
theoretical education and harnessing skills most useful in corporate firms,
failing to offer more practical curricula that can adequately prepare youth
to work in entrepreneurial enterprises.

####Formal Education, Including Attitudes And Behaviours, Play A Role In Entrepreneurship####

* The lack of a basic business culture in most small-scale enterprises —
evidenced by traits such as procrastination, poor client management and
missing deadlines — may be attributed to the fact that few formally educated
employees have worked at entrepreneurial ventures. Such employee challenges
in most small businesses reduce their ability to retain long-term clients or
acquire new ones.

####Developing An Entrepreneurial Skills Base Requires A Shift In Culture####

* Society fails to encourage students to recognise or take advantage of their
inherent entrepreneurial potential, as society often values and respects
professionals over entrepreneurs. Parents and guardians pressure their wards
into studying more professional courses rather than entrepreneurial or
creative ones, sometimes even tagging them as ‘crazy’ when students make the
decision to work in start-up companies or develop their own businesses.

####Entrepreneurial Ventures Need Professional Skills####

* Often, entrepreneurs take on too much when trying to sustain their business,
which can eventually stunt growth. For entrepreneurial organisations to
grow, it is important to identify the professional skills needed for a
particular task or stage of growth, acknowledge existing strengths and gaps
on the team and then source the missing skills accordingly.

* Trust must also be established between businesses and service providers. Among
entrepreneurs, a significant fear exists that, whilst engaging advisory
services, the service providers may steal their business ideas.

####Financial Remuneration Is Not The Only Tool Available For Entrepreneurs To Attract Talent####

* The notion that remuneration always has to be monetary, and therefore that
small enterprises cannot attract the most talented staff, should be
revisited.

* It is true that in most cases entrepreneurs cannot compete with the more
structured companies for certain types of skilled talent; however, the
skills that small ventures require may actually not be available in the
regularjob market. Providing opportunities for problem solving in the work
environment, which offers increased individual responsibility, is an
effective means of attracting talented staff.

###Infrastructure###

####The Culture Of Innovation Is Lacking In Schools####

* Unreliable electricity supply, poor quality and limited breadth of road and
rail networks, and poor communications infrastructure are all highlighted as
having a significant impact on the cost of doing business.
