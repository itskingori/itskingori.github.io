Right after [I post an article emphasizing the lessons of failure to the
point of breaking it down to two types][1] ... I stumble on this.

> I don't understand the cultural fascination with failure being the source
> of great lessons to be learned. What did you learn? You learned what
> didn't work. Now you won't make the same mistake twice, but you're just as
> likely to make a different mistake next time. You might know what won't
> work, but you still don't know what will work. That's not much of a
> lesson.

> Instead, put most of your energy into studying your successes. What have
> you done right? What worked? Why did it work? How you can repeat it?
> Instead of making something worse a little better, how about making
> something good a little better? Don't spend so much time looking down.
> Look up more.

Ah. Brill all over.
