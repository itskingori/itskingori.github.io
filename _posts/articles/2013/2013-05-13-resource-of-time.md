_"Time is highly limited, uniquely limited, and equitably limited."_

> #### Highly limited:

> Each person only has 24 hours a day and no more.  In total, we have about
> 70-80 years worth of time granted to us.  We use about a third of that for
> sleep, and necessarily almost another third for life-maintenance activities.
> We spend the first couple decades in various stages of physical and emotional
> immaturity, and the last couple decades in similarly declining health.

> #### Uniquely limited:

> Unlike many other resources, time is neither bankable, transferable, nor
> recoverable once spent (i.e. in contrast to resources like money, fuel, or
> other commodities).  It is constantly being expended, whether consciously or
> not, making time management an activity you must (or can) constantly engage
> in.

> #### Equitably limited:

> The average American human life expectancy is about 77 years, with a standard
> deviation of about 16 years.  This is a fairly equitable distribution of this
> resource for most people, compared to natural resource distribution amongst
> countries or levels of wealth between families, where both can often differ by
> many orders of magnitude.

> [...]

> What this means is that along with other resources, time is also always
> expended in the performance of any activity, that strategies which save or
> compress the amount of time needed to perform an activity (e.g. speed) are
> especially valuable, that few people are born with significant advantages in
> this resource compared another, and that tradeoffs involving the exchange of
> most commodity resources (e.g. money) for time are almost always a good idea.

> Guard your time jealously, and spend it carefully on the most important
> things. Likewise, it's crucial to figure out as early as possible what you
> consider the most important things to you in life, because if you greatly mis-
> prioritize, you may grieve later on for your lost time and life.  No pressure.
