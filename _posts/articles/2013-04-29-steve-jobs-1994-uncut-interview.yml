    > I've actually always found something to be very true, which is, most
    > people don't get those experiences cause they never ask. I've never found
    > anybody that didn't want to help me if I asked them for help. I always
    > call them up.

    > ... I called up Bill Hewlett when I was twelve years old and he lived in Palo
    > Alto, his number was still on the phone book and he answered the phone
    > himself and said,

    > _"Yes"_

    > _"Hi, I'm Steve Jobs I'm twelve years old, I'm a student in high school and
    > I wanna build a frequency counter and I was wondering if you had any
    > spare parts that I could have?"_

    > And he laughed and he gave me the spare parts to build this frequency
    > counter and he gave me a job that summer at Hewlett Packard, working on
    > the assembly line and putting nuts and bolts together on frequency
    > counters. He got me a job at the place that built them and I was in
    > heaven.

    > And ... I've never found anyone who said no or hang up the phone when I
    > called. I just asked. And when people ask me I try to be as responsive and
    > pay that that debt of gratitude back. Most people never pick up the phone
    > and call, most people never ask and that's what separates sometimes the
    > people that do things from the people that just dream about them ... you
    > gotta, you gotta act and you gotta be willing to fail, you gotta be
    > willing to crash and burn. With people on the phone ... with starting a
    > company with whatever, if you are afraid of failing you won't get very
    > far.
