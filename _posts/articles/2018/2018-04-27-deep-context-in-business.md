> It means that programming skill in the absence of business domain knowledge is
> becoming increasingly worthless.
>
> Said another way, there are an ever decreasing number of software problems
> that are so cut and dried that they can be tossed over a wall and implemented
> in isolation of business expertise.

> [...] The higher you move up the value chain in terms of your
> business offering, the more that the variations inherent in the business
> problems and technology constraints become wickedly complex.

> Deep context is the state of having achieved a kind of mental fluency in some
> large percentage of this immense field of micro-problems that appears in the
> space between technology and a business domain. It doesn’t mean that you’ve
> driven the uncertainty in a software project down to zero (once again, not
> possible), but it means that you’ve travelled the territory often enough that
> you’ve got a handle on the major geographical features. Every new software
> project requires forging a new path through the wilderness, but having deep
> context means that you know where the treacherous canyons and fast-flowing
> rivers are. You can anticipate the biggest risks, and you have a grasp on the
> scale of the risks you’re taking. You know how much you know, and how much you
> don’t know about the journey ahead.

> To give you an example, one developer I know who has attained deep context has
> been working in the space of warehouses and fulfillment technologies for 10
> years. He knows that you can’t ship a lawnmower via airfreight because it
> contains a battery for the starter motor (and airfreight policy disallows
> this). He knows that capacity planning is more predictable for Black Friday
> than it is for Christmas because buying patterns are heavily impacted by day-
> of-the-week, and Christmas falls on a different day of the week each year,
> while Black Friday is always on a Friday. He knows hundreds of thousands of
> other facts like these, each of which constitutes a micro-problem whose
> solution was hard-won. It was learned out in the field, by releasing software
> and watching it perform optimally or suboptimally, over and over again.
