> The greatest misconception about software development is that it is a

> knows how to code, then they can email a few notes or a specification. "Good
> to go", right?

> Not so much. At the outset, a business problem might appear simple, or only
> somewhat complex. You might think you have a handle on all the caveats and
> corner cases. But the average person who hasn't programmed extensively doesn't
> appreciate the level of detail and explicitness that computers require to do
> absolutely anything. Every behavior must be dictated with excruciating
> specificity. And your plan for how users will interact with the system will
> likely get thrown out and redrawn from scratch dozens of times before you have
> a minimum viable product.

> Most of the time is spent thinking and communicating about a virtually endless
> number of micro-problems that seemingly emerge out of nowhere, and constitute
> the real territory between the technology and the business problem. Part of
> traversing this landscape of micro-problems is inventing, communicating, and
> internalizing a plethora of named and unnamed abstractions. It is the only way
> to break down the complexity so you can grapple with it.
