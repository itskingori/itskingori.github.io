    I'm seriously considering teaching. Somewhere. Anywhere.

    > Back in 2006 I was spending all of my time getting better at Web design —
    > particularly CSS. I was pretty good at coding cross-browser layouts, and I
    > considered myself an intermediate Web designer.

    > At the same time, [Chris Coyier][1] started writing [CSS-Tricks][2]. I
    > remember reading his first articles and thinking, _“Oh, I know that
    > already. What qualifies Chris to teach when he doesn’t know any more than
    > I do?”_

    > I was a bit arrogant.

    > But Chris kept putting out CSS tutorials, and I kept patting myself on the
    > back for already knowing the skills he was teaching. But then, as my
    > friends started asking me questions about CSS, I found myself linking to
    > Chris’ articles, not just because they saved me the effort of having to
    > explain myself, but also because they were really well written.

    > Fast forward another year or two, and I was consulting his articles
    > myself, sometimes just for reference, but other times to learn new skills.
    > While we started at the same level, Chris had improved much more quickly
    > than I did.

    > **The difference was that he was teaching**.
