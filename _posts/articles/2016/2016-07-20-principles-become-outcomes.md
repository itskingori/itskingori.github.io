> Here is where the notion of “over-night” success comes from. Anything on an
> exponential curve looks small at the beginning. When you first start a habit,
> the effects are minor. However, overtime, they become major. Thus, out-of-
> nowhere, someone emerges onto the scene. What you didn’t see were the years of
> consistent preparation that got them there. Principles govern.

> The same holds true of the reverse. Obesity, debt, identity confusion, broken
> marriages. These things are governed by principles, the compounded effect of
> daily decisions.

> Small things become big things, _always_.
