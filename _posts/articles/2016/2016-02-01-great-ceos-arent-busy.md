> I remember hearing Jack Dorsey's now-famous quote that great CEOs are
> "editors", not "writers". And if you start to "write" more than you "edit",
> you've hired the wrong person.
>
> > Your job as an executive is to edit, not write. It's OK to write once in a
> > while but if you do it often there's a fundamental problem with the team.
> > Every time you do something ask if you're writing or editing and get in the
> > mode of editing.
>
> Simple translation — if you start to do the work of your executive team,
> you've hired the wrong people. They should share their decisions and strategy
> with you, but you shouldn't be creating it for them.
