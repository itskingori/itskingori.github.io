> Facebook is the only platform that lets advertisers target a mass audience
> with very fine demographic precision. Google you lose the demographics.
> Television, you lose the the precision.

> All advertising platforms deliver fraudulent/worthless/imaginary/bogus views.
> Print has a problem with publishers making up circulation numbers. Television
> has a problem with ads running while no one is watching. Radio has a massive
> problem as their listener numbers have collapsed. The display ad exchanges
> have tremendous problems. Mobile apps have an incredible amount of accidental
> clicks which may often either be 10 year olds trying to play a game or just
> outright fake. Video ad networks have a problem with ads auto-playing on
> repeat that are seen and heard by no one.

> Google and Facebook are about the easiest to deal with, by far.
