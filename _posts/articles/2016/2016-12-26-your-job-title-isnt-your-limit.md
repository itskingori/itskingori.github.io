> I'm often asked why I joined a DevRel organization. Why am I a [Developer
> Advocate][link-2]?

> When I think of the role, Developer Advocate, I think of it being the CTO for
> a project or product.

> As a Developer Advocate (CTO) my job is to understand the big picture and
> leverage my technical abilities to help deliver working solutions.

> A Developer Advocate (CTO) must work across departments including Sales,
> Product, and Engineering to form a customer driven feedback loop.

> A Developer Advocate (CTO) works with C level executives to explain the
> business value, and can jump on a whiteboard with their engineers.

> A Developer Advocate (CTO) listens.

> A Developer Advocate (CTO) recognizes patterns across customer conversations
> and distills them into actionable items the team can deliver.

> A Developer Advocate (CTO) tracks key issues, does what they can to fix them,
> then follows up with the customer. This is the feedback loop.

> A Developer Advocate (CTO) is not a lone wolf and relies on a strong Product
> and Engineering team to execute; completing the feedback loop.

> A Developer Advocate (CTO) is not an alias for Public Speaker. We give talks
> to share a vision; and perfect it.

> If you haven't caught on yet, there is no limit to what a Developer Advocate
> (CTO) can do. Don't let your job title limit your impact.
