> There's nothing wrong with loving what you do, of course – I just don't think
> it's a prerequisite for starting a business or building a fulfilling career,
> let alone doing great work. In fact, I think it's disingenuous for really
> successful people to put so much of the focus on love, just as it's
> disingenuous for really rich people to say money doesn't matter. People tend
> to romanticize their own motivations and histories. They value what matters to
> them now, and forget what really mattered to them when they started. It's
> human nature, so it's an easy thing to do.

> The way I see it, many great businesses and important innovations are actually
> born out of frustration or even hate. Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, the
> co-founders of Uber, didn't start their ride-sharing service because they
> loved transportation or logistics. They started it because they were pissed
> off that they couldn't get a cab in San Francisco. Kalanick may love running
> Uber today, but he really hated not having a way to get home. A random
> brainstorming session one night in Paris turned that frustration into the seed
> of a multibillion-dollar company.

> I talk to other entrepreneurs all the time, and many of their companies sprang
> into existence for similar reasons—because the founder wanted something that
> didn't exist or scoped out an opportunity to do something better than it had
> been done before. Love for their subject matter may or may not play a role in
> their stories, but hate for the existing options, along with strong opinions
> about how things could work, does and is a much better predictor of success.
