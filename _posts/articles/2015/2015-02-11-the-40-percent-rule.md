> I was at a board meeting recently and heard something I've not heard before
> from a late stage investor. He described what his firm called the 40% rule for
> a healthy software company, including business SaaS companies. These are for
> SaaS companies at scale – assume at least $50 million in revenue – but my
> _[Illusion of Product/Market Fit][1]_ for SaaS Companies correlates nicely
> with it once you hit about $1m of MRR.

> The 40% rule is that your growth rate + your profit should add up to 40%. So,
> if you are growing at 20%, you should be generating a profit of 20%. If you
> are growing at 40%, you should be generating a 0% profit. If you are growing
> at 50%, you can lose 10%. If you are doing better than the 40% rule, that's
> awesome.
