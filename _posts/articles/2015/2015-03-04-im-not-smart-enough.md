> The other day I was out with some friends. At some point in the night, a few
> of their other friends, whom I'd never met before, joined us. After
> introductions, we got into the typical "What do you do?"

> At this point, I explained that I teach people how to code and build their own
> web applications, "You know, like Facebook, or Pinterest."

> And then I got the all-too-common response:

> > "Oh. I'm not smart enough for that." _::awkward laugh::_

> And this upset me, as it does every. single. time.

> Why? Because most of the time it's simply _not true!_ It's a cop-out. A (lame) excuse.

> **What often looks like "smart," or "successful," is really just a combination
> of a bit of interest and a lot of persistence.**
