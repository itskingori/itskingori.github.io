Thoughts from Poul-Henning Kamp's "A Generation Lost in the Bazaar".

> That is the sorry reality of the bazaar Raymond praised in his book: a pile of
> old festering hacks, endlessly copied and pasted by a clueless generation of
> IT "professionals" who wouldn't recognize sound IT architecture if you hit
> them over the head with it. It is hard to believe today, but under this
> embarrassing mess lies the ruins of the beautiful cathedral of Unix,
> deservedly famous for its simplicity of design, its economy of features, and
> its elegance of execution. (_Sic transit gloria mundi_, etc.)

> One of Brooks's many excellent points is that quality happens only if somebody
> has the responsibility for it, and that "somebody" can be no more than one
> single personâ€”with an exception for a dynamic duo. I am surprised that Brooks
> does not cite Unix as an example of this claim, since we can pinpoint with
> almost surgical precision the moment that Unix started to fragment: in the
> early 1990s when AT&T spun off Unix to commercialize it, thereby robbing it of
> its architects.

> More than once in recent years, others have reached the same conclusion as
> Brooks. Some have tried to impose a kind of sanity, or even to lay down the
> law formally in the form of technical standards, hoping to bring order and
> structure to the bazaar. So far they have all failed spectacularly, because
> the generation of lost dot-com _wunderkinder_ in the bazaar has never seen a
> cathedral and therefore cannot even imagine why you would want one in the
> first place, much less what it should look like. It is a sad irony, indeed,
> that those who most need to read it may find _The Design of Design_ entirely
> incomprehensible.

I wrote up a [summary of "The Cathedral And The Bazaar"][1] 2 years ago.
Fascinating and brilliant read.
