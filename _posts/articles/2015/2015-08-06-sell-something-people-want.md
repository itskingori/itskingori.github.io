  > **Pete:** I'm sure there are plenty of sayings about good ideas, and how
  > sometimes, it's the most obvious one right in front of your nose that ended
  > up being the best... But it wasn't until we'd realized that, A., we really
  > weren't as great as we thought we were, and B., that the stuff was really
  > tough, that we went searching around for a problem that we could really
  > prove to ourselves that someone would pay for. So that was really big.

  > With CarrotSticks, it took us about six months to earn our first dollar.
  > With our second idea, it took a month and a half. And with Optimizely, we
  > were able to earn revenue on day one before we'd written any other code. And
  > that illustrates how we changed our thinking to focus on making sure we
  > found something people wanted before we built it.

  > **Aaron**: ...So Pete, the last thing that you just said was we needed to make
  > something people actually wanted, which is the model of Y Combinator. It's
  > on all of our shirts. It just says, "Make something people want." And I
  > think it's a really tough idea for a lot of people to actually internalize,
  > because they can find things that maybe they want. "I want a puppy." But
  > that might not be a startup. I think you gave me the answer. The way that
  > you actually figure out something that people want, that's actually a
  > business. It's that they are willing to pay for.

  > **Pete:** That was our proxy. Because we need up building a business that sold
  > things to people for actual money, I think, unlike a lot of tech startups,
  > we had an easy proxy there for demand. It was just trying to get someone to
  > pay for it.

  > **Aaron**: How long did it take for you to get someone to pay for it?

  > **Pete:** It was a single day, actually, with Optimizely.

  > **Aaron**: One day?

  > **Pete:** Dan called a couple of agencies that he'd worked with on the Obama
  > campaign and just described, "This is what we are working on. Will you pay
  > us $1,000 a month for access to early versions of it?" And sure enough, two
  > of them signed up. And we earned more revenue that one day than we had the
  > entire preceding year with our two startups.

  > **Aaron**: Wow! Did you have the software yet?

  > **Pete:** We had nothing.

  > **Aaron**: You had nothing?

  > **Pete:** We had nothing.

  > **Aaron**: So you sold a promise of future software?

  > **Pete:** We sold a promise of future software.
