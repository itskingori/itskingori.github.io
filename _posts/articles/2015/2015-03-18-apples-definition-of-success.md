> There's this thing in technology, almost a disease, where the definition of
> success is making the most. How many clicks did you get, how many active users
> do you have, how many units did you sell? Everybody in technology seems to
> want big numbers. Steve never got carried away with that. He focused on making
> the best.

> That took a change in my own thinking when I came to the company [Cook left
> Compaq to join Apple in 1998]. I had been in the Windows world before that,
> and that world was all about making the most. It still is.

> When Apple looks at what categories to enter, we ask these kinds of questions:
> What are the primary technologies behind this? What do we bring? Can we make a
> significant contribution to society with this? If we can't, and if we can't
> own the key technologies, we don't do it. That philosophy comes directly from
> him and it still very much permeates the place. I hope that it always will.

~ Tim Cook
