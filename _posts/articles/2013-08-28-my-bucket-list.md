    This is an attempt at being accountable to myself in regards to the simple
    desires of my heart throughout my lifetime. It is also a means for me to
    trace 'progress' and God's faithfulness over the years.

    > A number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or
    > accomplish during their lifetime. Comes from the term "kicked the bucket".

    > **bucket list**  
    > _noun_  
    > /ˈbʌkɪt lɪst/
