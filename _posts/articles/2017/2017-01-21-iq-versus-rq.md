### Differentiating Smarts from Decision-Making Skills

> IQ measures something real, and it is associated with certain outcomes. For
> example, thirteen-year-old children who scored in the top decile of the top
> percent (99.9th percentile) on the math section of the SAT were eighteen times
> more likely to earn a doctorate degree in math or science than children who
> scored in the bottom decile of the top percent (99.1st percentile).

> RQ is the ability to think rationally and, as a consequence, to make good
> decisions. Whereas we generally think of intelligence and rationality as going
> together, Stanovich's work shows that the correlation coefficient between IQ
> and RQ is relatively low at .20 to .35. **IQ tests are not designed to capture
> the thinking that leads to judicious decisions**.

> Stanovich laments that almost **all societies are focused on intelligence when
> the costs of irrational behavior are so high**. But you can pick out the
> signatures of rational thinking if you are alert to them. According to
> Stanovich, they include adaptive behavioral acts, efficient behavioral
> regulation, sensible goal prioritization, reflectivity, and the proper
> treatment of evidence.

> Your SAT scores shed little light on any of these qualities. So the first
> lesson in assessing your own decisions or those of others is to consider IQ
> and RQ separately. Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO)
> of Berkshire Hathaway, equates **IQ to the horsepower of an engine and RQ to
> the output**. We all know people who are high on IQ but average or low on RQ.
> Their efficiency is poor. **There are others without dazzling IQs but who
> consistently make sound decisions. They are highly efficient**.

Emphasis mine.
