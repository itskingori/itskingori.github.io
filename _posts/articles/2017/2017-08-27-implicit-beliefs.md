> We all have implicit beliefs, which we cling to without even thinking about.
> Well, that is why they are implicit, rather than explicit. For most part,
> implicit beliefs are good: they reduce the mental load of questioning
> everything and allow us to go along with our lives.

> To break those implicit beliefs is hard, and requires sound proof. We salute
> those who can show our implicit beliefs to be wrong.

> Before Einstein, there was implicit belief that the interval of time is
> independent of frame of reference. No one talked about it, because no one
> thought about it. It was just true. It required Einstein to break that belief.
