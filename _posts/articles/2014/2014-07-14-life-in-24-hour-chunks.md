> In several of his speeches, Charlie Munger has referred to Sir William Osler,
> the Canadian physician and co-founder of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The first to
> bring medical students out of the classroom and directly into the hospital for
> clinical training, he is often described as the "Father of Modern Medicine."

> Osler was a fascinating, accomplished, and erudite man who liked to quote
> Thomas Carlyle’s prescription that "Our main business is not to see what lies
> dimly in the distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand."

> As I followed up on Osler, I quickly came to his speech "A Way of Life,"
> delivered to students at Yale University in 1913. True to Carlyle’s
> prescription, Osler proposes that men work steadily towards success and
> fulfillment in life by taking the world in strict 24-hour increments, letting
> neither yesterday nor tomorrow be a worry today. (He called it "Life in day-
> tight compartments.")

> While we are all fools to some extent, Osler expounds on the value of putting
> one foot in front of the other and slowly progressing.

> > I wish to point out a path in which the way-faring man, though a fool,
> > cannot err; not a system to be worked out painfully only to be discarded,
> > not a formal scheme, simply a habit as easy or as hard to adopt as any other
> > habit, good or bad ... The way of life that I preach is a habit to be
> > acquired gradually by long and steady repetition: It is the practice of
> > living for the day only, and for the day’s work; Life in day-tight
> > compartments.
