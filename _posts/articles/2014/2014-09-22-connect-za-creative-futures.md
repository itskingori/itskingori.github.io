I was fortunate enough to be part of the [Connect ZA Creative
Futures][creativefuturesza] which brought 16 of the hottest digital, design,
music, performance and visual arts creatives from across the globe gathering in
the heart of Johannesburg (various venues and spaces around [Braamfontein][2])
for 3 days of creative exchanges, collaborations, talks, performances and
parties.

The gathering was a [British Council Connect ZA][bcconnectza] initiative in
association with [Live SA][livesa] and a part of the [Fak’ugesi Digital Africa
Festival][fakugesi].


### J'Burg Visual Tour

We were given a visual experience tour of Johannesburg led by Future Sounds of
Mzansi filmmaker Lebogang Rasethaba ([@LebooRabaji][26]). It was a great
opportunity to engage in dialogue around the geography of Johannesburg and the
way its people move through and interact with it as a space. For example, the
[Maboneng Precinct][27] and the [Drill Hall][28] to mention a few.


### Free, Public and Open Conversation

Took part in industry and open public events ...

#### Business in the Digital Age

There was discussion on _'Business in the digital age'_ touching on how digital
has changed the way business is done today, digital marketing strategies, how
creative entrepreneurs are adapting to the migration to digital, digital
solutions to business challenges, and the importance of branding in the digital
age.

#### Business of Fashion

There was also a discussion on the _'Business of Fashion'_. We explored and
debated on what the essence of ZA fashion is, definitions and the reality of
being a fashion entrepreneur, distribution of ZA fashion labels, the
similarities and differences in the fashion industry across the globe – namely
UK, Nigeria and ZA, and finally how fashion designers can accelerate efficient
business practice.

#### Business of Music

On music we discussed new marketing strategies for music, music
entrepreneurship, opportunities and threats of digital, and emerging DIY
business models.


### Internal Conversations

We even brainstormed in groups to solve common business challenges by sharing
our experiences, ideas and worldviews about the marketplace.

### Food Jam

We also took part in a fun [Food Jam][11], a concept was started by Jade de Waal
as an excuse to bring a group of friends together in her favourite place, the
kitchen. [Food Jams][11] are social gatherings in which eating food is only half
the fun! We, the participants, were paired up, and each team was given a portion
of the meal to prepare and invited to follow the recipe and if ingredients ran
out we were encouraged to improvise.

This obviously doesn't capture the entire experience but at least it gives you a
sneak peek into what I found to be _**a life changing experience with amazing
people**_.
