[According to Wikipedia][3]:

> The name of the strategy refers to the way ink spots spread on a piece of

> cover most or all of the paper.

A [fine article by Farnam Street][2] gives a good example (excerpt) of it's
implementation by Wal-Mart from the book ['Sam Walton: Made In America'][1] ...

> Now that we were out of debt, we could really do something with our key
> strategy, which was simply to put good-sized discount stores into little one-horse
> towns which everybody else was ignoring. In those days, Kmart wasn’t going to
> towns below 50,000, and even Gibson’s wouldn’t go to towns much smaller than
> 10,000 or 12,000. We knew our formula was working even in towns smaller than
> 5,000 people, and there were plenty of those towns out there for us to expand
> into. When people want to simplify the Wal-Mart story, that’s usually how they
> sum up the secret of our success: “Oh, they went into small towns when nobody
> else would.” And a long time ago, when we were first being noticed, a lot of
> folks in the industry wrote us off as a bunch of country hicks who had
> stumbled onto this idea by a big accident.

> **Maybe it was an accident, but that strategy wouldn’t have worked at all if we
> hadn’t come up with a method for implementing it. That method was to saturate
> a market area by spreading out, then filling in.** In the early growth years
> of discounting, a lot of national companies with distribution systems already
> in place — Kmart, for example — were growing by sticking stores all over the
> country. Obviously, we couldn’t support anything like that.

> **But while the big guys were leapfrogging from large city to large city, they
> became so spread out and so involved in real estate and zoning laws and city
> politics that they left huge pockets of business out there for us. Our growth
> strategy was born out of necessity, but at least we recognized it as a
> strategy pretty early on.** We figured we had to build our stores so that our
> distribution centers, or warehouses, could take care of them, but also so
> those stores could be controlled. We wanted them within reach of our district
> managers, and of ourselves here in Bentonville, so we could get out there and
> look after them. **Each store had to be within a day’s drive of a distribution
> center.**

> We saturated northwest Arkansas. We saturated Oklahoma. We saturated Missouri.
> We went from Neosho to Joplin, to Monett and Aurora, to Nevada and Belton, to
> Harrisonville, and then on to Fort Scott and Olathe in Kansas — and so on.
> Sometimes we would jump over an area, like when we opened store number 23 in
> Ruston, Louisiana, and we didn’t have a thing in south Arkansas, which is
> between us and Ruston. So then we started back - filling south Arkansas. In
> those days we didn’t really plan for the future. We just felt like we could
> keep rolling these stores out this way, and they would keep working, in
> Tennessee, or Kansas, or Nebraska — wherever we decided to go. But we did try
> to think ahead some when it came to the cities. **We never planned on actually
> going into the cities. What we did instead was build our stores in a ring
> around a city — pretty far out — and wait for the growth to come to us.** That
> strategy worked practically everywhere. We started early with Tulsa, putting
> stores in Broken Arrow and Sand Springs. Around Kansas City, we built in
> Warrensburg, Belton, and Grandview on the Missouri side of town and in Bonner
> Springs and Leavenworth across the river in Kansas. We did the same thing in
> Dallas.

> **This saturation strategy had all sorts of benefits beyond control and
> distribution. From the very beginning, we never believed in spending much
> money on advertising, and saturation helped us to save a fortune in that
> department. When you move like we did from town to town in these mostly
> rural areas, word of mouth gets your message out to customers pretty quickly
> without much advertising.** When we had seventy-five stores in Arkansas,
> seventy-five in Missouri, eighty in Oklahoma, whatever, people knew who we
> were, and everybody except the merchants who weren’t discounting looked
> forward to our coming to their town. By doing it this way, we usually could
> get by with distributing just one advertising circular a month instead of
> running a whole lot of newspaper advertising. We’ve never been big
> advertisers, and, relative to our size today, we still aren’t. Just like
> today, we became our own competitors. In the Springfield, Missouri, area, for
> example, we had forty stores within 100 miles. When Kmart finally came in
> there with three stores, they had a rough time going up against our kind of
> strength.

> **So for the most part, we just started repeating what worked, stamping out
> stores cookie-cutter style.** The only decision we had to make was what size
> format to put in what market. We had five different store sizes—running from
> about 30,000 to 60,000 square feet — and we would hardly ever pass up any
> market because it was too small. I had traveled so much myself looking at
> competitors in the variety store business that I had a good feel for the kind
> of potential in these communities. Bud and I knew what we wanted in the way of
> locations. Like so many of the ideas that have made our company work from the
> beginning, we’re still more or less following this same strategy, although
> today we’ve moved into some cities outright. But **I think our main real estate
> effort should be directed at getting out in front of expansion and letting the
> population build out to us.**

Emphasis, mine.

Seems like a brilliant read! Doesn't it? Well you can [buy it][1].
