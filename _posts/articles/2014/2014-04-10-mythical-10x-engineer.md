> In this post, I'm going to argue that the problem is that we're looking in the

> good—we should instead be looking on how to improve our own teams, and make

* **Source lines of code (SLOC)**, also known as **lines of code (LOC)**, is a
  software metric used to measure the size of a computer program by counting the
  number of lines in the text of the program's source code. SLOC is typically
  used to predict the amount of effort that will be required to develop a
  program, as well as to estimate programming productivity or maintainability
  once the software is produced. ~ [from Wikipedia][1]
