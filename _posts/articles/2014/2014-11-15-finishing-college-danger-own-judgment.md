On Aaron Swartz ...

> "I've hired a lot of very talented programmers, and one of the things I
> discovered was that the people who didn't graduate from college couldn't
> finish projects," his father says.

> "Because when you go to college, there's all sorts of stupid stuff you have to
> do in order to get through." "He had thousands of pages of notes about
> different things," Quinn Norton says.

> "Books he was reading, books he was writing, theories he had. He started
> writing a bunch of different books. One was a novel, there were books on
> social theoryâ€”he didn't finish any of them." "He was freed of all the
> disciplining experiences of life," Lawrence Lessig says.

> "His parents got him out of school early, which was great because it allowed
> him to become somebody who wasn't the product of puberty in a public school.
> But it was bad in the sense that it gave him a confidence about his own
> judgment, which is dangerous."
