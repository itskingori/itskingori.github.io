From [Wikipedia][1]:

> The hedonic treadmill, also known as hedonic adaptation, is **the supposed
> tendency of humans to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness
> despite major positive or negative events or life changes**. According to
> this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in
> tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness. Brickman and Campbell
> coined the term in their essay "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good
> Society" (1971). During the late 1990s, the concept was modified by Michael
> Eysenck, a British psychologist, to become the current "hedonic treadmill
> theory" which compares the pursuit of happiness to a person on a treadmill,
> who has to keep working just to stay in the same place.
