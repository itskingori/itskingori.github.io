> But the idea that the culture Mr Bezos has created is so demanding and
> abrasive that colleagues cannot stick it is not borne out by a look at his
> executive team, many of whom have worked with him for years

> And for all his Wall Street drive, there's more to Mr Bezos' mentality than a
> desire to crush the competition through hard work and discounting prices.
> There is also an intellectual ambition to get to the bottom of knotty problems
> by the application of brainpower.

> One of Mr Bezos' ideas is that when hiring new staff, "Amazonians" should
> always pick someone smarter than themselves. That way the overall level of
> intelligence at the company will keep on rising. (Apparently he has not found
> anyone smart enough to replace himself yet.)

> The focus on brainpower is seen daily in the way meetings are conducted. They
> typically consist of the reading and discussion of a six-page "narrative",
> which is the distillation of an issue and a proposed solution put forward by
> one of the participants.

> With narratives, arguments have to be made explicit in old-fashioned prose and
> figures, presented in detail so everyone can examine the case for themselves.
> So meetings often consist of people sitting and reading silently for 30
> minutes, and making notes before cross-examining the author.

> Former manager Dave Cotter says: "It's a really intellectual exercise that,
> once you go through it a few times, you realise how powerful it is." Now that
> he has left Amazon, Mr Cotter says he has discovered "most of the world does
> not follow that kind of intellectual rigour".
