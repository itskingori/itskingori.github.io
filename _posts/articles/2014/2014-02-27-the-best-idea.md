> Turning ambition into success is hard enough as it is. Whether you’re taking
> time to work on a project on the side or you’re launching a full-time
> business, it’s going to require peak personal investment. Not in terms of
> working crazy hours, but of dedication and perseverance.

> Why would you want to pour so much of yourself into anything less than your
> best idea? Other ideas might seem more achievable or convenient, but if your
> heart and mind is elsewhere it’s all for naught.
