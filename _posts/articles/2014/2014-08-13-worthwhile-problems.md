> The worthwhile problems are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the

> problems until you find some you can really solve easily, no matter how
> trivial. You will get the pleasure of success, and of helping your fellow man,
> even if it is only to answer a question in the mind of a colleague less able
> than you. You must not take away from yourself these pleasures because you
> have some erroneous idea of what is worthwhile.
