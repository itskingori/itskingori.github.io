> _At some point in your career, this will become relevant:_

> At the very least:

> * Don’t pull up the ladder.
> * Acknowledge that a ladder existed.
> * Don’t mock those on the ladder after you.

> When you can:

> * Point out ladders to others.
> * Study some ladders.
> * Make better and more ladders.
