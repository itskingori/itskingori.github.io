> Rule 1: "The war room and the meetings are for solving problems. There are
> plenty of other venues where people devote their creative energies to shifting
> blame."

> Rule 2: "The ones who should be doing the talking are the people who know the
> most about an issue, not the ones with the highest rank. If anyone finds
> themselves sitting passively while managers and executives talk over them with
> less accurate information, we have gone off the rails, and I would like to
> know about it." (Explained Dickerson later: "If you can get the managers out
> of the way, the engineers will want to solve things.")

> Rule 3: "We need to stay focused on the most urgent issues, like things that
> will hurt us in the next 24--48 hours."
