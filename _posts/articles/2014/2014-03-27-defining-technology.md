> 1. Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is
just a natural part of the way the world works.

> 2. Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new
and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.

1. From [the book's Wikipedia page][1], _"The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the
Galaxy One Last Time is a posthumous collection of previously published and
unpublished material by [Douglas Adams][3]. It consists largely of essays about
technology and life experiences, but its major selling point is the inclusion of
the incomplete novel on which Adams was working at the time of his death, The
Salmon of Doubt (from which the collection gets its title, a reference to the
[Irish myth][4] of the [Salmon of Knowledge][5])."_
