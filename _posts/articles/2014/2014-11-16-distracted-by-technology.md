> The technology world is filled with cases where smart and superior
> alternatives exist, but their existence makes no difference because you can't
> use them. 1980s UNIX was incredibly stable compared to MS-DOS, but it was
> irrelevant if you intended to use MS-DOS software. Clojure and Factor are
> wonderful languages, but if you want to write iOS games then you're better off
> pretending you've never heard of them. Not only are they not good options for
> iOS, at least not at the moment, but going so against the grain brings extra
> work and headaches with it.

> Words like "better," "superior," and "right," are misleading. Yes, Modula-2
> has a beautiful module system, but that's negated by being a fringe language
> that isn't likely to be available from the start when exciting new hardware is
> released. Erlang isn't as theoretically beautiful as those cutting-edge
> research languages, but it's been through the forge of shipping large-scale
> systems. What may look like warts upon first glance may be the result of
> pragmatic choices.

> There's much more fun to be had building things than constantly being
> distracted by better technology.
