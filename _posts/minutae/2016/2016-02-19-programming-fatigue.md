This was published as "[JavaScript fatigue fatigue][source]" but I feel it applies to programming in general.

> Enough with the fatigue – tips against feeling overwhelmed:
>
>  * Don't try to know everything – it's impossible in modern web development. Given that there is always more to know, it doesn't matter that much what you learn (unless you have a specific need).
>    * Go for depth in areas you love.
>    * Go for breadth and on-demand learning in areas you are merely interested in or think you should know more about.
>  * Wait for the critical mass. You can often afford to get started by reading the opinions of people you trust and wait it out until new ideas prove themselves.
>  * Stick to things you understand: don't use more than 1–2 new technologies per project.
>    * It's important to retain at least some feeling of control.
>    * Every technology that people need to learn before they can use your project raises the barrier of entry and makes it more difficult to find collaborators, colleagues and employees.
>  * Do exploratory toy projects: I like creating small projects that explore technologies or aspects of technologies.
>  * Diversify in life: Specializing is good, but it's also good to have regular activities not related to tech and/or brain. The advantage is that if you are frustrated in one area of your life, you have others to fall back on.
>  * Even with the last of the previous tips, I find it important to remain human. Don't overdo discipline, don't become a life improvement machine. Periods of boredom and doing nothing are important for recuperating and inspiration.
>
> When in doubt about what to learn next, you can always go back to fundamentals:
>
>  * JavaScript, CSS, etc. (which technologies are fundamental depends on your work)
>  * Non-technological skills: time management, social skills (communication, team building, …), health (posture, breathing properly, moving well, eating well, …), management processes and so on.
