According to [the official site][3]:

> Haste is the prettiest, easiest to use pastebin ever made.

[Download the source][1] and expand it.

Install the [Node.js Package Manager][2] using [Homebrew][4] _(for Mac OS)_,
like so ...

```bash
$ brew install npm
```

Different OS have different package managers, use whatever works for you. For
example ... for [Debian based distro's][8] you'd probably use `apt-get install
npm` and for [RPM based distro's][9] would use `yum install npm` and so on.

While in the expanded directory install all the required dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Set the configuration. In my case I didn't want to use [Redis][5] as my data
store and opted to use the filesystem instead, saving the data in
`APP_ROOT/data/`. Note the `storage:` attribute.

```json
{
  "host": "0.0.0.0",
  "port": 7777,
  "keyLength": 10,
  "maxLength": 400000,
  "staticMaxAge": 86400,
  "recompressStaticAssets": true,
  "logging": [
    {
      "level": "verbose",
      "type": "Console",
      "colorize": true
    }
  ],
  "keyGenerator": {
    "type": "phonetic"
  },
  "storage": {
    "path": "./data",
    "type": "file"
  },
  "documents": {
    "about": "./about.md"
  }
}

```

Then start the server:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Server should now be running on _0.0.0.0:7777_.

The above example shows a local deployment, if you want to set up the server in
a publicly accessible (via a network or the internet) ... just change the host
and port accordingly.

```json
{
  "host": "example.com",
  "port": 80
}
```

Server should now be running on _example.com_ since port 80 is usually the
default port.
