title: "2016: Year In Review üéâ"
category: blog
layout: post
---

Inspired by [Julia Evan's own "2016: Year In Review"][jvns-2016] ... this is the
start of an archive/reflection of sorts that I hope to get into the habit of
writing down every year's end. It focuses on career growth and avoids the
personal stuff.

### Conferences üìù

1. [Rubyfuza](http://www.rubyfuza.org/2016.html) (4th-5th February)
2. [DevOps Days Cape Town](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2016-capetown/welcome/) (7th-8th November)

### Open Source üíª

* [Found a bug and filed an issue][link-1] in the [@kubernetes/kops][link-2]
  project and eventually managed to [submit a PR with a fix][link-3]. üèÜ
* [Filed an interesting issue with `osxfs`][link-6] in the [@docker/for-
  mac][link-7] project. Didn't find a fix, but at least [I was able to find a
  temporary solution to get us going][link-12].
* Started a new Ruby gem, `mpesa` ([@itskingori/mpesa-gem][link-4]) which
  attempts to make it dead easy to interact with the [M-Pesa G2 API][link-5] in
  Ruby (WIP).
* Open sourced [zappi/oauth2_proxy][link-8], one of the docker images we use [at
  work][zappistore].

### Toolset üõ†

Last year I got started with DevOps sometime in October and I hit the ground
running with:

* ELK+F stack - centralise log collection for easier and fast debugging using:
  * [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch] ‚Äì stores and indexes logs.
  * [Logstash][logstash] ‚Äì parses, stores and indexes logs.
  * [Kibana][kibana] ‚Äì dashboard to access logs in Elasticsearch e.g. search.
  * [Filebeat][filebeat] ‚Äì ships logs to Logstash.
* TIG stack - centralise metric collection, also for easier and faster debugging
  using:
  * [Telegraf][telegraf] ‚Äì ships metrics to InfluxDB.
  * [Grafana][grafana] ‚Äì dashboard to access metrics stored in InfluxDB.
  * [InfluxDB][influxdb] - stores and indexes metrics.
* [Chef][chef] ‚Äì automation solution for both infrastructure and applications
* [Docker][docker] ‚Äì encapsulate applications securely isolated in a container,
  packaged with all its dependencies and libraries.
* [Elastic Container Service][ecs] (ECS) ‚Äì  Amazon's container management
  service on AWS that supports Docker containers and allows you to run
  applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

This year I maintained that momentum mostly by building upon the foundation laid
in Oct-Dec last year:

* [Ansible][ansible] ‚Äì automation engine that automates cloud provisioning,
  configuration management, and application deployment.
* [Kubernetes][kubernetes] ‚Äì platform for automating deployment, scaling, and
  operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing
  container-centric infrastructure.
* [Kubernetes-Kops][kubernetes-kops] ‚Äì tool to deploy Kubernetes clusters from
  the command line, with options that support H/A masters (on AWS).
* [Terraform][terraform] ‚Äì tool for building, changing, and versioning
  infrastructure safely and efficiently.

I've also gotten way way *way* better at:

[Access Control][computer-access-control] ‚Ä¢¬†[Amazon AWS][aws] ‚Ä¢ [Bash][bash] ‚Ä¢ [Continuous Deployment][continuous-deployment] ‚Ä¢ [Continuous Integration][continuous-integration] ‚Ä¢ [Git][git] ‚Ä¢ [Linux][linux] ‚Ä¢ [Networking][computer-networking] ‚Ä¢¬†[Python][python] ‚Ä¢ [Ruby][ruby]+[Rails][rails] ‚Ä¢ [Security][computer-security]

### The Next 8,760 Hours üéØ

* [Read more books][link-9].
* [Write more about the things that I learn][link-10].
* Give a talk at a conference (at a minimum, a lightning talk).
* Get way more stuff out (and keep a better record of it) for a better "2017:
  Year In Review". ;-)

1. I learnt a lot more than what's listed here. Unfortunately I didn't blog much
   this year so this is really the best attempt at capturing the highlights that
   I remember.
2. I'm not at liberty to share some of the details of the stuff I work on.
   There's a lot of fun stuff that I got exposed to so that cuts out another big
   chunk! Hopefully, we'll be able to set up an engineering blog to formally
   share work stories.
