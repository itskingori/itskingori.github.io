These are tips collated from various sources _(links at the bottom)_.


### Supervisor

> Your success is as important to you as it is to him/her if he/she is a good
> advisor. [[~1][1]]


### What Is A Thesis?

> There are two different ways to get an CS master's degree here: by doing a
> thesis or a project. With a thesis it is your ideas that are central to the
> degree, while in a project it is what you create (software or hardware) that
> is central. In both cases you must make a contribution to the existing body of
> knowledge/experience. For the project, you take more courses, in the thesis
> you do more research and have a more formal presentation at the end. Basically
> a thesis subsumes a project. A thesis uses a project as a proof of concept,
> but also describes what is conceptually novel and how this work fits into the
> context of existing work in the field. [[~1][1]]


### Why Write A Thesis?

> A master's degree makes more of a contribution to the field than a project. If
> you want to do more than spend your life writing code for other people, a
> thesis can be a good way to demonstrate that you are capable of collecting and
> organizing the material to survey an area, define a novel contribution, and
> then make that contribution. [[~1][1]]


### Area review

> Begin by looking through conference proceedings, journals, online, books, etc.
> Xerox relevant papers AND any papers that interest you. Sometimes what you are
> looking for may lead you to find something that you had not intended but may
> be more interesting. Papers are fuel for your ideas. This is your chance to
> discover what the rest of the world is doing. This is an important step
> because it gives you a broad view of your discipline.

> Read all the papers you've found (or as many as you can) and after reading
> each one enter it into an **annotated bibliography**. This is a bibliography
> that contains a full reference of the paper and a 2 paragraph summary of the
> paper. Pay special attention to write personal notes like _"this is a good
> paper"_, _"I liked it because..."_.

> [...]

> Talk to your advisor about what you are reading. He/She should be able to
> point you towards other resources. Use the WWW. If you find an interesting
> paper then look at the author's web site and see what links are there. What
> new projects is he/she working on? What new papers may have been published?
> [[~1][1]]


### Choosing the Thesis Area

> Once you've chosen an area you need to think carefully about what its
> contribution is. In general a thesis is a new contribution to the field you
> are studying. You cannot simply duplicate work that has already been done. You
> need to make an improvement. Sometimes it is useful to draw a table with
> authors on one axis and what they do in the other axis. This will allow you to
> see what areas are still new and have not been addressed yet.

> Another way to find new thesis areas is to look at the Future Work sections of
> papers. Many times the future work sections include work that the author will
> never get to because there are simply too many things to work on. [[~1][1]]


### Articulating Your Thesis

> Try to be as specific as possible about what you want to achieve in your
> thesis. This is for your benefit as well as your advisor because coming up
> with a 'contract' of what is expected of you will avoid any nasty surprises in
> the future.

> Your thesis commitee will basically see if you are able to answer the
> following questions in your thesis. You need to find a good and convincing
> answer for this in order to pass:

> * What is the **problem** you are trying to solve? Or what is the research
>   **question** you are trying to answer?
> * Why is this problem/question **worth** solving/asking? Who would care?
> * How have other people in the past tried to solve/answer it?
> * What is your **new** approach to solving/answering this problem? Or what improvement are you making on an existing solution?
> * How do you prove that the solution you came up with is a **good** solution?
> * How can you demonstrate that your solution works?
> [[~1][1]]


### Perform a Feasibility Study

> Try and implement a few ideas on the computer to "concretize" your thesis
> ideas. [[~1][1]]


### Implement The Thesis

> If it is a program or algorithm use the techniques you learned in software
> engineering to design, build and document your system. Remember the purpose of
> a thesis is a product that generations after you can use and improve on. In
> fact you may consider at this point to write a paper for a conference. The
> process of writing a technical paper always forces you to think rationally
> about your thesis; to find its good points and its weaknesses. Feedback from
> conference reviewers can sometimes be useful too. [[~1][1]]


### Demostrating That Your System Works & Is Good

> * Build a demo program around your algorithm to illustrate how it would be
>   used in an application. Use this same demonstration when you present your
>   final thesis.
> * Gather a group of users and have them use your system; perform a user study.
>   Usually about 5 is enough. More the better.
> * If your thesis is heavily human-factors based you may need to think up a way
>   to measure success **quantitatively** - i.e. using statistics. This is
>   difficult. You need to talk to your advisor about this.
> * Publish a paper in a conference. This adds credibility to your work. For
>   Masters you should publish 1 conference paper before you graduate.
> [[~1][1]]


### Graduation

> The thing to remember is that you must learn to find a path and follow a path
> by yourself. Your advisor can only help you find the path and help you learn
> to find a path. Then it is entirely up to you to walk the path.You are only
> ready to graduate when you can do all of this by yourself. If you need your
> advisor to tell you every next step then you are **_NOT_** ready to graduate.
> [[~1][1]]
