Once again, keeping on the spirit of yearly reviews, here's 2018's review! ðŸ˜…
[Last year my focus was on Kubernetes][2017-review]. This year, it seems my
focus hasn't yet shifted.

I failed at almost every every goal I'd set for myself for 2018 ðŸ™ˆ, but crossed
other significant milestones so I'm not going to be too hard on myself. I
planned a wedding, got married, worked remotely for Â¾ of the year ... so that's
gotta count for something. I'm optimistic 2019 is going to be better.

I also became the team lead of the devops team [where I work][zappi], which
means I've moved into a role that will exercise my leadership and management
skills.

Other stuff includes ...
