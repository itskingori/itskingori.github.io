![job-kingori-maina](/assets/images/cover-image-2@2x.jpg "Job King'ori Maina")

I'm **{{site.data.me.fullname}}** (Job King'ori Maina), a Kenyan, and I often go
under the alias _"itskingori"_ online. I use these aliases to chat and share
useful links [on Twitter][twitter] and ... to share code [on GitHub][github].

This is an attempt at creating a portfolio of sorts and occassionally
['Publishing What I Learn'][1] under articles/thoughts -
[here][articles_archive], blog - [here][blog_archive] and code minutae -
[here][minutae_archive] ... whenever I can.

I also love God, _**deeply**_ & I'm constantly trying to be a man of character
... in a world of compromise.

Correspondence can be done via [j@kingori.co][email] or
[{{site.data.profiles.twitter.handle}}][twitter]. I'm between [Cape Town,
South Africa][4] and [Nairobi, Kenya][5] ... ping me if you're ever in the area
and would fancy a face-to-face meet.

For additional privacy: [my PGP public key][6].
