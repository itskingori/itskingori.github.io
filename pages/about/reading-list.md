1. 2006-2010 were my undergraduate years. I read no material outside my academic
   curriculum. School was hard, and that was enough reading for me. My priority
   was just getting done. Sidenote, the Internet wasn't easy to come by back
   then, especially in campus, so I didn't get much reading online either.
2. 2011-2012 were my Samsung days. First job out of campus, I was busy getting
   used to work and distracted by the money that comes with it. I'm not
   surprised that I didn't get much reading done. What changed in this period is
   that I got a smartphone, Internet became _ubiquitous_, I had access to the
   Internet at work and had enough money to afford mobile data outside of work.
   My reading shifted to online sources (mostly on mobile) because the Flipboard
   news app aggregated a lot of the news that I was interested in.
3. In 2013, I resigned from Samsung to become an entreprenuer in a tech startup
   that I co-founded. I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands. Most of my
   reading was on the technologies that I would use to build the service that
   the business provided. And so I read a lot about programming, particularly on
   Ruby and Internet infrastructure.
4. Admittedly, I'm not sure that the books listed in 2013 were actually read in
   that year. However, in hindsight, it does make sense if they were. At that
   point I was trying to understand all I could about success (from a personal
   and business perspective). So I'm not surprised that those books piqued my
   interest at the time.
5. 2014-2015 were my postgraduate years. I was reading enough papers. I really
   didn't see a need to add more to the pile.
6. Towards the end of 2015 I got a job that flung me right into DevOps. I read a
   lot about DevOps and I learnt **a lot**!
7. 2016 had me still focused on DevOps and settling into a my new career and
   other personal transitions.
8. 16th December 2016 I renewed my commitment to pick up a habit to reading
   books without giving excuses (refer to excuses 1-7). We'll see how it goes.
