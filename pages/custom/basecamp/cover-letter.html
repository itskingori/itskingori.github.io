      <h2><a href="/basecamp/cover-letter/">HEY Basecamp</a>,</h2>

      <br>

      <p>I'm <b><a href="/">King'ori Maina</a></b>. About 7 years ago, I
      stumbled on the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://m.signalvnoise.com">signalvnoise.com</a> blog back when you
      were still called <a target="_blank"
      href="https://37signals.com">37signals</a>. I've been an avid subscriber
      since then. Basecamp's ideas have shaped my views on a lot of topics;
      starting from <i>work culture</i>, <i>remote work</i>, <i>product
      design</i>, <i>business focus</i>, <i>privacy</i> etc.</p>

      <p>If you would have told me then, that I would be applying for a <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamps-ops-team-is-hiring/">System
      Administrators role</a> on your <a target="_blank"
      href="https://basecamp.com/handbook/appendix-04-titles-for-ops">Operations
      Team</a>, I wouldn't have believed you. But as fate would have it, here
      were are. Am I scared?
      <i>Heck Yeah!</i> Despite that, I'm up for the challenge because I believe
      we would be a <b>good fit</b> for each other from a <b>technical</b>,
      <b>cultural</b>
      and
      <b>values</b> point of view.</p>

          <p><b>TECHNICAL FIT</b><br>Starting off a software developer, Ruby is
          my favourite programming language and Ruby on Rails is my go-to
          framework. I've been running Rails in production for most of my
          professional career and that includes my side-projects as well.
          <b>Ruby on Rails is my bread and butter</b>.</p>

          <p>Right now, as a DevOps engineer, <a target="_blank"

          successfully designed and managed scalable and stable infrastructure
          running on self-managed Kubernetes clusters on AWS for the past 4 years</a>
          (starting from v1.4.7). I also have production experience with a lot
          of the tools used by the Operations Team i.e. Docker, GitHub Actions,
          MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, Terraform and Percona Tools. I probably
          wouldn't know everything about your systems but <b>I'd be familiar
          with your standard stack</b>, right off the bat.</p>

          <p>I'm also familiar with Linux and its fundamentals, good at shell
          scripting and <a target="_blank" href="/sanaa/">able to build
          microservices and CLIs in Go</a>. <b>I have all the hallmarks of a

      <p>While I enjoy working with computers, I do have other interests. I
      <i>love</i> spending time with <a target="_blank"
      href="https://twitter.com/lagugu">my wife (Gugu)</a>, dining out, taking
      long roadtrips and <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.instagram.com/itskingori/">taking photos while
      travelling</a>. When I get the chance, I <a target="_blank"
      href="https://twitter.com/itskingori/status/1276194941044129792">put in
      some practice on the bass</a> while geeking out on bass guitar theory and
      history.</p>

      <p>Working at Basecamp would be a <i>huge opportunity</i> for me to grow.
      I'd love to have the opportunity to chat more about my work and who I am
      as a person. I hope I'll be hearing from you soon.</p>
