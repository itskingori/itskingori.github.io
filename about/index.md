I'm **King'ori J. Maina** _(Job King'ori Maina)_ and I usually go under the
alias _itsmrwave_. Sometimes, I use these aliases to chat [here][twitter] and
sometimes to put up code [here][github].

This is an attempt at creating a portfolio of sorts and occassionally
['Publishing What I Learn'][1] under thoughts/articles -
[here][articles_archive] & code minutae - [here][minutae_archive] ... when I
can.

I also love God, _**deeply**_ & I'm constantly trying to be a man of character
... in a world of compromise.

Correspondence can be done via [j@kingori.co][email]. I'm currently based in
[Cape Town, South Africa][4] ... if you would like a face-to-face meet.

For additional privacy: [my PGP public key][6].
