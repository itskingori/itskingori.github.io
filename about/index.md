![job-kingori-maina](/assets/images/cover-image@2x.jpg "Job King'ori Maina")

I'm **{{site.author.fullname}}** (Job King'ori Maina), a Kenyan, and I often go under
the alias _"itsmrwave"_ online. I use these aliases to chat and share useful links
[on Twitter][twitter] and ... to put up or contribute to code [on
GitHub][github].

This is an attempt at creating a portfolio of sorts and occassionally
['Publishing What I Learn'][1] under thoughts/articles -
[here][articles_archive] & code minutae - [here][minutae_archive] ... when I
can.

I also love God, _**deeply**_ & I'm constantly trying to be a man of character
... in a world of compromise.

Correspondence can be done via [j@kingori.co][email] or
[{{site.author.twitter}}][twitter]. I live in [Cape Town, South Africa][4]
... ping me if you're ever in the area and would fancy a face-to-face meet.

For additional privacy: [my PGP public key][6].
