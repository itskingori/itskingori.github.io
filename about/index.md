![job-kingori-maina](/assets/images/cover-image@2x.jpg "Job King'ori Maina")

I'm **King'ori J. Maina** _(Job King'ori Maina)_ and I usually go under the
alias _itsmrwave_. Sometimes, I use these aliases to _'rant'_ [here][twitter],
play around with code [here][github] ... occasionally share informative stuff
[here][googleplus].

Like my life, this (the entire collective), is a draft and probably will always
be a work in progress, minimal so that's it's as timeless as possible ... this
was (and still is) an attempt at creating a portfolio of 'sorts' and
occassionally ['Publishing What I Learn'][1] under thoughts/articles -
[here][articles_archive] &amp; code minutae - [here][minutae_archive] ... when I can.

I also love God, _**deeply**_&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; constantly trying to be a man of
character ... in a world of compromise.

When I'm not [riding lions][2] or [studying][5]; I _'jump on monkey bars'_ and rock Puma's.

Correspondence can be done via [yo@kingori.co][email]. I'm currently based in
[Cape Town, South Africa][4] ... if you would like a face-to-face meet.
